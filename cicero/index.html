<p>Quintus Mucius Scaevola, the augur,used to relate with an accurate
memory, and in apleasing way many incidents about his father-in‑law,
Gaius Laelius, and, in every mention of him, didnot hesitate tocall
him "the Wise." Now, I,upon assuming the toga virilis ,had been
introduced by my father to Scaevola with theunderstanding that, so far
as Icould and he wouldpermit, I shouldnever leave the old man's side.
And so itcame topass that, in my desire to gain greaterprofit from
his legal skill, I made it apractice tocommit to memory many of his
learned opinions and many, too, of his brief andpointed sayings. After
his death I betook myself to thepontiff, Scaevola, who, both in
intellect and in integrity, was, I venture to assert, quite the most
distinguished man of our State. But of him I shall speak at another
time;now I return to the augur.</p>
<p>Numerous events in the latter's life often recur to me, but the most
memorable one of all occurred at his home, as he was sitting, according
to hiscustom, on a semi-circular garden bench, when I and only a few of
his intimate friends were with him, and he happened to fallupon a topic
which, just about that time, was in manypeople's mouths. You, Atticus,
were much in the society of Publius Sulpicius, and on that account are
the morecertain to remember what great astonishment, or rather
complaining, there was among thepeople when Sulpicius, whileplebeian
tribune, separated himself in deadly hatred from the thenconsul,
Quintus Pompeius, with whom he had lived on the most intimate and
affectionate terms. And so, Scaevola, havingchanced to mention this
very fact, thereuponproceeded to repeat tous a discussion on
friendship, which Laelius had had with him and with another son-in‑law,
Gaius Fannius, son of Marcus, a few days after the death of Africanus. I
committed the mainpoints of that discussion to memory, and have set
them out in thepresent book in my own way; for I have, so to speak,
brought the actors themselves on the stage in order to avoid too
frequent repetition of "said I" and "said he," and tocreate the
impression that they arepresent and speaking inperson. For while you
werepleading with me again and again to write something on friendship,
the subject appealed to me as both worthy of general study, and also
well fitted to our intimacy. Therefore I havenot beenunwilling to
benefit thepublic at your request. But, as in my Cato the Elder , which
was written to you on the subject of old age, I represented Cato, when
an old man, as theprincipal speaker, because I thoughtno one more
suitable to talk of thatperiod of life than he who had been old a very
long time and had been a favourite of fortune in old age beyond other
men; so, since we had learned from our forefathers that the intimacy of
Gaius Laelius and Publius Scipio was mostnoteworthy, Iconcluded that
Laelius was a fitperson to expound the very views on friendship which
Scaevola remembered that he had maintained. Besides, discourses of this
kind seem in some way to acquire greater dignity when founded on the
influence of men of ancient times, especially such as are renowned; and,
hence, in reading my own work on Old Age I am at times so affected that
I imagine Cato is the speaker andnot myself. But as in that book I
wrote as one old man to another old man on the subject of old age, so
now in this book I have written as a most affectionate friend to a
friend on the subject of friendship. In the former work the speaker was
Cato, whom scarcely any in his day exceeded in age andnone surpassed in
wisdom; in thepresent treatise the speaker on friendship will be
Laelius, a wise man (for he was so esteemed), and a man who was
distinguished by a glorious friendship. Pleaseput me out of your mind
for a little while and believe that Laelius himself is talking. Gaius
Fannius and Quintus Mucius Scaevola havecome to their father-in‑law's
house just after the death of Africanus;theconversation is begun by
them and reply is made by Laelius, whose entire discourse is on
friendship, and as you read it you will recognize in it aportrait of
yourself.</p>
<p>Fannius. What you say is true, Laelius; for there wasno better man than
Africanus, andno one more illustrious. But you should realize that all
men have fixed their eyes on you alone; you it is whom they bothcall
and believe to be wise. Recently this title was given to Marcus Cato and
we know that Lucius Acilius wascalled "the Wise" in our fathers' time,
but each of them in a somewhat different way: Acilius because of his
reputation for skill incivil law; Cato because of his manifold
experience, and because of the many well-known instances wherein both in
Senate and forum he displayed shrewdness of foresight, resolution of
conduct, or sagacity in reply; and as a result, by the time he had
reached old age, he bore the title of "the Wise" as a sort ofcognomen.
But as to yourself, men are wont tocall you wise in a somewhat
different way,not only because of your mental endowments andnatural
character, but also because of your devotion to study and because of
yourculture, and they employ the term in yourcase,not as the ignorant
do, but as learned men employ it. And in this sense we haveunderstood
thatno one in all Greece was "wise" except one in Athens, and he,I
admit, was actually adjudged "most wise" by the oracle of Apollo — for
the morecaptiouscritics refuse to admit those who arecalled "The
Seven" into thecategory of the wise. Your wisdom, inpublic estimation,
consists in this: youconsider all yourpossessions to be within
yourself and believe human fortune of less account than virtue. Hence
the question isput to me and to Scaevola here, too, I believe, as to
how you bear the death of Africanus, and the inquiry is the more
insistent because, on the last Nones,when we had met asusual for the
practiceof our augural act in thecountry home of Decimus Brutus, you
werenotpresent, though it had been yourcustom always to observe that
day and to discharge its duties with the most scrupulouscare.</p>
<p>Scaevola. There is indeed a great deal of questioning, Gaius Laelius,
just as Fannius has said, but I state in reply what I have observed:
that you bear withcomposure thepain occasioned by the death of one who
was at once a most eminent man and your very dear friend; that youcould
not beunmoved thereby and that to be so wasnotconsistent with your
refined and tendernature and yourculture; but as to yournot attending
ourcollege on the Nones, that, I answer, was due to ill-health andnot
to grief.</p>
<p>Laelius. Your reply was excellent, Scaevola, and it wascorrect; forno
personal inconvenience of any kind ought to have kept me from the
discharge of the duty you mentioned, and which I have alwaysperformed
when I was well,nor do I think itpossible for any event of thisnature
tocause a man of strongnature toneglect any duty. Now as for your
saying, Fannius, that so great merit is ascribed to me — merit such as I
neither admitnorclaim — you are very kind; but it seems to me that
your estimate of Cato is scarcely high enough. For eitherno man was
wise — which really I think is the better view — or, if anyone, it was
he. Putting aside all otherproof,consider how he bore the death of his
son! I remembered thecase of Paulus, and I had been aconstant witness
of the fortitude of Gallus, but their sons died in boyhood, while Cato's
son died in theprime of life when his reputation was assured.
Therefore, takecarenot to give theprecedence over Cato even to that
man, whom, as you say, Apollo adjudged the wisest of men; the former is
praised his deeds, the latter for his words.</p>
<p>Now, as to myself, let me address you both at once and beg you to
believe that thecase stands thus:If I were to assert that I amunmoved
by grief at Scipio's death, it would be for "wise" men to judge how far
I am right, yet, beyond a doubt, my assertion would be false. For I am
indeed moved by the loss of a friend such, I believe, as I shallnever
have again, and — as Ican assert onpositive knowledge — a friend such
asno other man ever was to me. But I amnot devoid of a remedy, and I
find very greatconsolation in thecomforting fact that I am free from
the delusion whichcauses most men anguish when their friends depart. I
believe thatno ill has befallen Scipio; it has befallen me, if it has
befallen anyone; but great anguish for one's own inconveniences is the
mark of the man who lovesnot his friend but himself.</p>
<p>But who would say that all hasnot gone wonderfully well with him ? For
unless he had wished to live for ever — a wish he was very far from
entertaining — what was there,proper for a human being to wish for,
that he didnot attain? The exalted expectation which hiscountry
conceived of him in hischildhood, he at a bound, through incredible
merit, more than realized in his youth. Though henever sought the
consulship, he was electedconsul twice — the first timebefore he was of
legal age, the second time at aperiod seasonable for him, but almost
too late for the safety of thecommonwealth. And he overthrew the two
cities that were the deadliest foes of our empire and therebyput an end
not only to existing wars, but to future wars as well. Whyneed I speak
of his most affable manners, of his devotion to his mother, of his
generosity to his sisters,of his kindness to his relatives, of his
strict integrity to all men? These things are well known to you both.
Moreover, how dear he was to the State was indicated by the grief
displayed at his funeral. How, then,could he have gained any advantage
by the addition of a few more years of life? For even though old age may
not be a burden — as I remember Cato, the year before he died,
maintained in a discourse with Scipio and myself — yet it does take away
that freshness which Scipio kept even to the end.</p>
<p>Therefore, his life really was such thatnothingcould be added to it
either by good fortune or by fame; and, besides, the suddenness of his
death took away theconsciousness of dying. It is hard to speak of the
nature of his death; you both know whatpeople suspect;yet I may say
with truth that, of the very many joyous days which he saw in thecourse
of his life — days thronged to theutmost with admiringcrowds — the
most brilliant was the day before he departed this life, when, after the
adjournment of the Senate, he was escorted home toward evening by the
Conscript Fathers, the Romanpopulace, and the Latin allies, so that
from so lofty a station of human grandeur he seems to havepassed to the
gods on high rather than to the shades below.</p>
<p>For I donot agree with those who have recently begun to argue that soul
and bodyperish at the same time, and that all things are destroyed by
death. I give greater weight to the old-time view, whether it be that of
our forefathers, whopaid such reverential rites to the dead, which they
surely wouldnot have done if they had believed those rites were a
matter of indifference to the dead; or, whether it be the view of
thosewho lived in this land and by theirprinciples andprecepts brought
culture to Great Greece,whichnow, I admit, is wholly destroyed, but was
then flourishing; or, whether it be the view of him who was adjudged by
the oracle of Apollo to be the wisest of men, who, though he would argue
on most subjectsnow on one side andnow on the other, yet always
consistently maintained that human souls were of God; thatupon their
departure from the body a return to heaven lay open to them, and that in
proportion as each soul was virtuous and just would the return be easy
and direct.</p>
<p>Scipio held this same view, for only a few days before his death, in the
presence of Philus, Manilius and several others (you were there, too,
Scaevola, having gone with me), he, as if with apremonition of his
fate, discoursed for three days on thecommonwealth, and devoted almost
all of theconclusion of the discussion to the immortality of the soul,
makinguse of arguments which he had heard, he said, from Africanus the
Elder through a vision in his sleep. If the truth really is that the
souls of all good men after death make the easiest escape from what may
be termed the imprisonment and fetters of the flesh, whomcan we think
of as having had an easier journey to the gods than Scipio? Therefore, I
fear that grief at such a fate as his would be a sign more of envy than
of friendship. But if, on the other hand, the truth rather is that soul
and bodyperish at the same time, and thatno sensation remains, then,
it follows that, as there isnothing good in death, so, of acertainty,
there isnothing evil. For if a man has lost sensation the result is the
same as if he hadnever been born; and yet the fact that Scipio was born
is a joy tous and willcause this State to exult so long as it shall
exist.</p>
<p>Wherefore, as I have already said, it has gone very well with him, less
so with me, for, as I was before him in entering life, it had been more
reasonable to expect that I should have been before him in leaving it.
Still, such is my enjoyment in the recollection of our friendship that I
feel as if my life has been happy because it was spent with Scipio, with
whom I shared mypublic andprivatecares; livedunder the same roof at
home; served in the samecampaigns abroad, and enjoyed that wherein lies
the whole essence of friendship — the mostcomplete agreement inpolicy,
inpursuits, and in opinions. Hence, I amnot so much delighted by my
reputation for wisdom which Fannius justnowcalled to mind, especially
since it isundeserved, as I am by the hope that the memory of our
friendship will always endure; and this thought is the morepleasing to
me because in the whole range of history only three or fourpairsof
friends are mentioned; and I venture to hope that among such instances
the friendship of Scipio and Laelius will be known toposterity.</p>
<p>Fannius. Thatcannot be otherwise, Laelius. But since you have mentioned
friendship and we are free frompublic business, it would be very
agreeable tous — and to Scaevola, too, I hope — if, following your
usualpractice on other subjects when questionsconcerning them areput
to you, you would discuss friendship and giveus your opinion as to its
theory andpractice.</p>
<p>Scaevola. Indeed it will be agreeable to me, and, in fact, I was about
to make the same request when Fannius forestalled me. Hence your
compliance will be very agreeable tous both.</p>
<p>Laelius. Icertainly should raiseno objection if I feltconfidence in
myself, for the subject is anoble one, and we are, as Fannius said,
free frompublic business. But who am I? or what skillhave I? What you
suggest is a task forphilosophers and, what is more, for Greeks — that
of discoursing on any subject however suddenly it may beproposed to
them. This is a difficult thing to do and requiresno littlepractice.
Therefore, for a discussion of everythingpossible to be said on the
subject of friendship, I advise you to apply to those whoprofess that
art; all that Ican do is tourge you toput friendship before all
things human; fornothing is soconformable tonature andnothing so
adaptable to our fortunes whether they be favourable or adverse.</p>
<p>This, however, I do feel first of all — that friendshipcannot exist
except among good men;nor do I go into that too deeply,as is done by
thosewho, in discussing thispoint with more thanusual accuracy, and it
may becorrectly, but with too little view topractical results, say
thatno one is goodunless he is wise. We may grant that; but they
understand wisdom to be a thing such asno mortal man has yet attained.
I, however, am bound to look at things as they are in the experience of
everyday life andnot as they are in fancy or in hope. Nevercould I say
that Gaius Fabricius, Manius Curius, and Tiberius Coruncanius, whom our
ancestors adjudged to be wise, were wise by such a standard as that.
Therefore, let the Sophists keep theirunpopularandunintelligible word
to themselves, granting only that the men justnamed were good men. They
willnot do it though; they will say that goodnesscan bepredicated
only of the "wise" man. Letus thenproceed "with our own dull wits," as
the saying is. Those who so act and so live as to giveproof of loyalty
anduprightness, of fairness and generosity; who are free from all
passion,caprice, and insolence, and have great strength ofcharacter —
men like those just mentioned — such men letusconsider good, as they
were accounted good in life, and also entitled to becalled by that term
because, in as far as that ispossible for man, they follow Nature, who
is the best guide to good living.</p>
<p>For it seemsclear to me that we were socreated that betweenus all
there exists acertain tie which strengthens with ourproximity to each
other. Therefore, fellowcountrymen arepreferred to foreigners and
relativesa to strangers, for with them Nature herself engenders
friendship, but it is one that is lacking inconstancy. For friendship
excels relationshipb in this, that goodwill may be eliminated from
relationship while from friendship itcannot; since, if you remove
goodwill from friendship the veryname of friendship is gone; if you
remove it from relationship, thename of relationship still remains.
Moreover, how great thepower of friendship is may mostclearly be
recognized from the fact that, incomparison with the infinite ties
uniting the human race and fashioned by Nature herself, this thing
called friendship has been sonarrowed that the bonds of affection
alwaysunited twopersons only, or, at most, a few.</p>
<p>For friendship isnothing else than an accord in all things, human and
divine,conjoined with mutual goodwill and affection, and I am inclined
to think that, with the exception of wisdom,no better thing has been
given to man by the immortal gods. Someprefer riches, some good health,
somepower, somepublic honours, and many evenprefer sensualpleasures.
This last is the highest aim of brutes; the others are fleeting and
unstable things and dependent lessupon human foresight thanupon the
fickleness of fortune. Again, there are those whoplace the "chief good"
in virtue and that is really anoble view; but this very virtue is the
parent andpreserver of friendship and without virtue friendshipcannot
exist at all. Toproceed then, letus interpret the word "virtue" by the
familiarusage of our everyday life and speech, andnot inpompous
phrase apply to it theprecise standards whichcertainphilosophersuse;
and letus include in thenumber of good men those who are soconsidered
— men like Paulus, Cato, Gallus, Scipio, and Philus — who satisfy the
ordinary standard of life; but letuspass by such men as arenowhere to
be found at all.</p>
<p>Therefore, among men like those just mentioned, friendship offers
advantagesalmost beyond anypower to describe. In the firstplace, how
can life be what Enniuscalls "the life worth living," if it doesnot
repose on the mutual goodwill of a friend? What is sweeter than to have
someone with whom you may dare discuss anything as if you werecommuning
with yourself? Howcould your enjoyment in times ofprosperity be so
great if you didnot have someone whose joy in them would be equal to
your own? Adversity would indeed be hard to bear, without him to whom
the burden would be heavier even than to yourself. In short, all other
objects of desire are each, for the mostpart, adapted to a single end —
riches, for spending; influence, for honour;public office, for
reputation;pleasures, for sensual enjoyment; and health, for freedom
frompain and fulluse of the bodily functions; but friendship embraces
innumerable ends; turn where you will it is ever at your side;no
barrier shuts it out; it isneveruntimely andnever in the way.
Therefore, we donotuse theproverbial"fire and water" on more
occasions than weuse friendship. I amnotnow speaking of the ordinary
andcommonplace friendship — delightful andprofitable as it is — but of
thatpure and faultless kind, such as was that of the few whose
friendships are known to fame. For friendship adds a brighter radiance
toprosperity and lessens the burden of adversity by dividing and
sharing it.</p>
<p>Seeing that friendship includes very many and very great advantages, it
undoubtedly excels all other things in this respect, that itprojects
the bright ray of hope into the future, and doesnot suffer the spirit
to grow faint or to fall. Again, he who looksupon a true friend, looks,
as it were,upon a sort of image of himself. Wherefore friends, though
absent, are at hand; though inneed, yet abound; though weak, are
strong; and — harder saying still — though dead, are yet alive; so great
is the esteem on thepart of their friends, the tender recollection and
the deep longing that still attends them. These things make the death of
the departed seem fortunate and the life of the survivors worthy of
praise. But if you should take the bond of goodwill out of theuniverse
no house orcitycould stand,nor would even the tillage of the fields
abide. If that statement isnotclear, then you mayunderstand how great
is thepower of friendship and ofconcord from aconsideration of the
results of enmity and disagreement. For what house is so strong, or what
state so enduring that itcannot beutterly overthrown by animosities
and division? From this it may be judged how great good there is in
friendship. It is said, at any rate, that acertain learned man of
Agrigentumsang in inspired strain in Greek verse that innature and the
entireuniverse whatever things are at rest and whatever are in motion
areunited by friendship and scattered by discord. And indeed this is a
statement which all mennot onlyunderstand but also approve. Whenever,
therefore, therecomes to light some signal service inundergoing or
sharing the dangers of a friend, who doesnotproclaim it with the
loudestpraise? What shouts recently rang through the entire theatre
during theperformance of thenewplay, written by my guest and friend,
Marcus Pacuvius,at the scene where, the king being ignorant which of the
two was Orestes, Pylades, who wished to beput to death instead of his
friend, declared, "I am Orestes," while Orestescontinued steadfastly to
assert, as was the fact, "I am Orestes!" Thepeople in the audience rose
to their feet andcheered this incident in fiction; what, think we,
would they have done had it occurred in real life? In thiscase Nature
easily asserted her ownpower, inasmuch as men approved in another as
well done that which theycouldnot do themselves.</p>
<p>Within the foregoing limits I have, I think, been able to state my
estimate of friendship; if there is anything more to be said — and I
believe there is a great deal — inquire, if youplease, of those who
make a business of such discussions.</p>
<p>Fannius. But weprefer to inquire of you. I have, it is true, often
questioned those men too, and indeed havenot been anunwilling
listener, but the thread of your discourse is of a somewhat different
texture.</p>
<p>Scaevola. You would say so with greaterconfidence, Fannius, if you had
beenpresent recently in Scipio'scountry home during the discussion on
the Republic. What an advocate of justice Laelius was then against the
elaborate speech of Philus! Fannius. Ah ! but it was an easy thing for
the most just of men to defend justice. Scaevola. Well, then, wouldnot
the defence of friendship be easy for that man who haspreserved it with
theutmost fidelity,constancy, and sense of justice, and thereby gained
the greatest renown?</p>
<p>Laelius . Really you are employing violence; for what matters it what
means you take of forcing me? Forcing me youcertainly are. For it is
not only hard, butnot even right, to withstand the earnest requests of
one's sons-in‑law,particularly in a goodcause.</p>
<p>The oftener, therefore, I reflect on friendship the more it seems to me
thatconsideration should be given to the question, whether the longing
for friendship is felt on account of weakness and want, so that by the
giving and receiving of favours one may get from another and in turn
repay what he isunable toprocure of himself; or, although this mutual
interchange is really inseparable from friendship, whether there isnot
anothercause, older, more beautiful, and emanating more directly from
Nature herself. For it is love ( amor ), from which the word
"friendship" ( amicitia ) is derived, that leads to the establishing of
goodwill. For while it is true that advantages are frequently obtained
even from those who,under apretence of friendship, arecourted and
honoured to suit the occasion; yet in friendship there isnothing false,
nothingpretended; whatever there is is genuine andcomes of its own
accord. Wherefore it seems to me that friendship springs rather from
nature than fromneed, and from an inclination of the soul joined with a
feeling of love rather than fromcalculation of how muchprofit the
friendship is likely to afford. What this feeling is may beperceived
even in thecase ofcertain animals, which,up to acertain time, so
love their offspring and are so loved by them, that their impulses are
easily seen. But this is much more evident in man; first, from the
affection existing betweenchildren andparents, whichcannot be
destroyed except by some execrablecrime, and again from that kindred
impulse of love, which arises when once we have met someone whose habits
andcharacter arecongenial with our own; because in him we seem to
behold, as it were, a sort of lamp ofuprightness and virtue. For there
isnothing more lovable than virtue,nothing that more alluresus to
affection, since on account of their virtue anduprightness we feel a
sort of affection even for those whom we havenever seen. Is there
anyone who doesnot dwell with some kindly affection on the memory of
Gaius Fabricius and Manius Curius, though henever saw them? On the
other hand, is there anyone who doesnot hate Tarquin the Proud, Spurius
Cassius, or Spurius Maelius? Against two leaders we had bitter struggles
for the empire of Italy — Pyrrhus and Hannibal; for the former, because
of hisuprightness, we haveno great enmity; for the latter, because of
hiscruelty,this State will always entertain hatred.</p>
<p>Now if the force of integrity is so great that we love it, whether in
those we havenever seen, or, more wonderful still, even in an enemy,
what wonder that men's souls are stirred when they think they see
clearly the virtue and goodness of those with whom aclose intimacy is
possible? And yet love is further strengthened by the receiving of a
kindly service, by the evidence of another'scare forus, and bycloser
familiarity, and from all these, when joined to the soul's first impulse
to love, there springsup, if I may say so, a marvellous glow and
greatness of goodwill. Ifpeople think that friendship springs from
weakness and from apurpose to secure someone through whom we may obtain
that which we lack, they assign her, if I may so express it, a lowly
pedigree indeed, and an origin far fromnoble, and they would make her
the daughter ofpoverty and want. If this were so, then just in
proportion as any man judged his resources to be small, would he be
fitted for friendship; whereas the truth is far otherwise. For to the
extent that a man reliesupon himself and is so fortified by virtue and
wisdom that he is dependent onno one andconsiders all hispossessions
to be within himself, in that degree is he mostconspicuous for seeking
out andcherishing friendships. Now whatneed did Africanus have of
me?By Hercules!none at all. And I, assuredly, hadnoneed of him
either, but I loved him because of acertain admiration for his virtue,
and he, in turn, loved me, because, it may be, of the fairly good
opinion which he had of mycharacter; andclose association added to our
mutual affection. Although many and great advantages did ensue from our
friendship, still the beginnings of our love didnot spring from the
hope of gain. For as men of ourclass generous and liberal,not for the
purpose of demanding repayment — for we donotput our favours out at
interest, but are bynature given to acts of kindness — so we believe
that friendship is desirable,not because we are influenced by hope of
gain, but because its entireprofit is in the love itself.</p>
<p>From this view those men who, after the manner ofcattle, judge
everything by the standard ofpleasure, vigorously dissent;nor is it
strange; for the raising of the vision to anything lofty,noble and
divine is impossible to men who have abased their every thought to a
thing so lowly and mean. Therefore letus dismiss thesepersons from our
conversation and letus for ourselves believe that the sentiments of
love and of kindly affection spring fromnature, when intimation has
been given of moral worth; for when men haveconceived a longing for
this virtue they bend towards it and movecloser to it, so that, by
familiar association with him whom they have begun to love, they may
enjoy hischaracter, equal him in affection, become readier to deserve
than to demand his favours, and vie with him in a rivalry of virtue.
Thus the greatest advantages will be realized from friendship, and its
origin, being derived fromnature rather than from weakness, will be
more dignified and moreconsonant with truth. For on the assumption that
advantage is thecement of friendships, if advantage were removed
friendships would fall apart; but sincenature isunchangeable,
therefore real friendships are eternal. Younow have my views on the
origin of friendship,unless you have something to say in reply.
Fannius. Pray go on, Laelius, and I answer for my friend here, as I have
the right to do, since he is my junior. Scaevola. Well said, Fannius.
Therefore, letus hear.</p>
<p>Laelius. Then listen, most worthy gentlemen, to thepoints very
frequently mentioned between Scipio and me in our discussions of
friendship. Now he, indeed,used to say thatnothing was harder than for
a friendship tocontinue to the very end of life; for it often happened
either that the friendshipceased to be mutually advantageous, or the
parties to it didnot entertain the samepolitical views; and that
frequently, too, the dispositions of men werechanged, sometimes by
adversity and sometimes by the increasing burdens of age. And then he
would draw an illustration of thisprinciple from the analogy of early
life. "For," said he, "the most ardent attachments of boyhood are often
laid aside with the boyish dress;but ifcontinued to the time of
manhood, they are broken off, sometimes by rivalry incourtship or
sometimes by acontest for some advantage, in which both of theparties
to the friendshipcannot be successful at the same time. But should the
friendshipcontinue for a longer time, yet it is often overthrown when a
struggle for office happens to arise; for while, with the generality of
men, the greatest bane of friendship is the lust for money, with the
most worthy men it is the strife forpreferment and glory, and from this
source frequently have sprung the deadliest enmities between the dearest
friends."</p>
<p>"Then, too, disagreements of a very seriousnature, andusually
justifiable, arise from a demandupon friends to do something that is
wrong, as, for example, to become agents of vice or abettors in
violence, and when the demand is refused, however honourable the
refusal, it isneverthelesscharged by those to whom thecompliance was
denied that the laws of friendship have been disregarded; besides, those
who dare demand anything and everything of a friend, by that very demand
profess a willingness to do anything whatever for the sake of a friend.
By theirceaseless recriminationsnot only are social intimaciesusually
destroyed, but also everlasting enmities areproduced. So many dangers
of this kind," he would say, "hover like evil fates over friendships,
that it seems to me to require both wisdom and good luck to escape them
all."</p>
<p>Wherefore, letus firstconsider, if youplease, how far love ought to
go in friendship. Supposing Coriolanus to have had friends, were those
friends in duty bound to bear arms with him against theircountry? Or
ought the friends of Vecellinus, or of Maelius, to have supported them
in their attempts to gain regalpower?As to Tiberius Gracchus, when he
began to stirup revolution against the republic,we saw himutterly
deserted by Quintus Tubero and by the friends of his own age. And yet
Gaius Blossius of Cumae, aprotégé of your family,Scaevola,came to me
toplead for leniency, because I waspresent as adviser to theconsuls,
Laenas and Rupilius,and offered, as a reason for mypardoning him, the
fact that his esteem for Tiberius Gracchus was so great he thought it
was his duty to do anything that Tiberius requested him to do. Thereupon
I inquired, "Even if he requested you to set fire to the Capitol?" "He
never would have requested me to do that, ofcourse," said he, "but if
he had I should have obeyed." You see what an impious remark that was!
And, by heavens! he did all that he said he would do, or rather even
more; for he didnot follow, but he directed, the infatuation of
Tiberius Gracchus, and he didnot offer himself as thecomrade in the
latter's fury, but as the leader. And so, as a result of his madness,
being in fear of the specialcourt of inquiry, he fled into Asia, joined
our enemies, andpaid a heavy and righteouspenaltyfor hiscrimes
against the Republic.</p>
<p>Therefore it isno justification whatever of your sin to have sinned in
behalf of a friend; for, since his belief in your virtue induced the
friendship, it is hard for that friendship to remain if you have
forsaken virtue. But if we should resolve that it is right, either to
grant our friends whatever they wish, or to get from them whatever we
wish, then, assuming that we were endowed with truly faultless wisdom,
no harm would result; but I am speaking of the friends before our eyes,
of those whom we see, or of men of whom we have record, and who are
known to everyday life. It is from men of thisclass our examples should
be drawn, butchiefly, I grant you, from those who make thenearest
approach to wisdom. We read that Aemilius Papus was an intimate friend
of Gaius Luscinus (so we have received it from our forefathers), that
they served together twice asconsuls and werecolleagues in the
kinship. Again the tradition is that Manius Curius and Tiberius
Coruncanius were mostclosely associated with them and with each other.
Well, then, it is impossible forus even to suspect any one of these men
of importuning a friend for anythingcontrary to good faith or to his
solemn oath, or inimical to thecommonwealth. What is theneed of
asserting in thecase of men like these, that if such a request had been
made it wouldnot have been granted, seeing that they were thepurest of
men, and moreover, regarded it equally impious to grant and make such a
request? But Tiberius Gracchus did find followers in Gaius Carbo and
Gaius Cato,and he found a follower also in his own brother Gaius, who
thoughnot very ardent then isnow intensely so. Therefore let this law
be established in friendship:neither ask dishonourable things,nor do
them, if asked. And dishonourable itcertainly is, andnot to be
allowed, for anyone toplead in defence of sins in general and
especially of those against the State, that hecommitted them for the
sake of a friend. For, my dear Fannius and Scaevola, we Romans arenow
placed in such a situation that it is our duty to keep a sharp look-out
for the troubles that may befall our State. Ourpoliticalpractice has
already swerved far from the track andcourse marked out forus by our
ancestors. Tiberius Gracchus tried to obtain regalpower — or rather, he
actually did reign for a few months. Had the Romanpeople ever heard of
or experienced such a thing before? What his friends and relatives, who
followed him even after his death, did in thecase of Publius ScipioI
cannot describe without tears. As for Carbo, because of the short time
since thepunishment of Tiberius Gracchus,we have borne with him as best
wecould. Now what is to be expected when Gaius Gracchusbecomes tribune,
I amnot inclined toprophesy; º however, revolutioncreeps on
imperceptibly at first but once it has acquired momentum, rushes
headlong to ruin. You see how much mischief has beencaused already in
the matter of the ballot, first by the Gabinian law,and two years later
by the Cassian law. I seemnow to see thepeople estranged from the
Senate and the weightiest affairs of state determined by thecaprice of
the mob. For morepeople will learn how to start a revolution than how
to withstand it.</p>
<p>Why do I say these things? Because without associatesno one attempts any
such mischiefs. It must, therefore, be enjoinedupon good menthat if by
anychance they should inadvisedly fall into friendships of this kind,
they mustnot think themselves so bound that theycannot withdraw from
friends who are sinning in some important matter ofpublicconcern; for
wicked men, on the other hand, apenalty must be enacted, and assuredly
it willnot be lighter for the followers than for the leaders in
treason. Who was more eminent in Greece than Themistocles, who more
powerful? But he, after having saved Greece from slavery by his
leadership in the war with Persia, and after having been banished
because of hisunpopularity, wouldnot submit to the injustice of an
ungratefulcountry, as he was in duty bound to do: he did the same thing
that Coriolanus had done among ourpeople twenty years before. Not one
single supportercould be found to aid these men against theircountry;
therefore, each took his own life. Hence such alliances of wicked men
not only shouldnot beprotected by aplea of friendship, but rather
they should be visited with summarypunishment of the severest kind, so
thatno one may think itpermissible to follow even a friend when waging
war against hiscountry. And yet this very thing,considering thecourse
affairs have begun to take, willprobably happen at some future time; as
for me, I amno lessconcerned for what thecondition of the
commonwealth will be after my death, than I am for itscondition to‑day.</p>
<p>Therefore let this be ordained as the first law of friendship: Ask of
friends only what is honourable; do for friends only what is honourable
and without even waiting to be asked; let zeal be everpresent, but
hesitation absent; dare to give true advice with all frankness; in
friendship let the influence of friends who are wisecounsellors be
paramount, and let that influence be employed in advising,not only with
frankness, but, if the occasion demands, even with sternness, and let
the advice be followed when given. I say this becausecertain men who, I
am informed, areconsidered sages in Greece, have approvedcertain
views, which, in my opinion, are astonishing (but there isnothing that
those men willnotpursue with their subtleties). Some of these men
teach that too much intimacy in friendships should be avoided, lest it
benecessary for one man to be full of anxiety for many; that each one
ofus has business of his own, enough and to spare; that it is annoying
to be too much involved in the affairs of otherpeople; that it is best
to hold the reins of friendship as loosely aspossible, so that we may
either draw themup or slacken them at will; for, they say, an essential
of a happy life is freedom fromcare, and this the soulcannot enjoy if
one man is, as it were, in travail for many.</p>
<p>Again, there are others, I am told, who, with even less of human
feeling, maintain (and I briefly touched on thispoint justnow) that
friendships must be sought for the sake of the defence and aid they give
andnot out of goodwill and affection; therefore, that those least
endowed with firmness ofcharacter and strength of body have the
greatest longing for friendship; andconsequently, that helpless women,
more than men, seek its shelter, thepoor more than the rich, and the
unfortunate more than those who are accounted fortunate. Onoble
philosophy! Why, they seem to take the sun out of theuniverse when they
deprive life of friendship, than which we have from the immortal godsno
better,no more delightful boon. For of what value is their vaunted
"freedom fromcare"? In appearance it is indeed an alluring thing, but
in reality often to be shunned. For it is inconsistentnot toundertake
any honourable business orcourse ofconduct, or to lay it aside when
undertaken, in order to avoid anxiety. Nay, if wecontinually flee from
trouble, we must also flee from Virtue, whonecessarily meets with some
trouble in rejecting and loathing thingscontrary to herself, as when
kindness rejects ill-will, temperance lust, and braverycowardice. And
so you may see that it is the just who are mostpained at injustice, the
brave atcowardice, the self-restrained atprofligacy. It is, therefore,
characteristic of the well-ordered mind both to rejoice at good deeds
and to bepained at the reverse.</p>
<p>Wherefore, if distress of mind befalls a wise man (as itcertainly does
unless we assume that human sympathy has been rooted out of his heart),
why should we remove friendship entirely from our lives in order that we
may sufferno worries on its account? For when the soul is deprived of
emotion, what difference is there — I donot say between man and the
beasts of the field, but between man and a stock or a stone, or any such
thing? Nor are we to listen to those menwho maintain that virtue is hard
andunyielding and is, as it were, something made of iron; whereas, in
many relations of life, and especially in friendship, it is sopliable
and elastic that it expands, so to speak, with a friend'sprosperity and
contracts with his adversity. Wherefore, that mental anguish of which I
spoke and which often must be felt on a friend's account, hasno more
power to banish friendship from life than it has tocauseus to reject
virtue because virtue entailscertaincares and annoyances.</p>
<p>But, since, as I said before, virtue knits friendship together, if there
should be some exhibition of shining virtue to which a kindred spirit
may attach and adjust itself, then, when that happens, love mustneeds
spring forth. For is there anything so absurd as to delight in many
inanimate things, likepublic office, fame, and stately buildings, or
dress andpersonal adornment, and to take little orno delight in a
sentient being endowed with virtue andcapable of loving, and — if I may
so term it — of loving back?Fornothing gives morepleasure than the
return of goodwill and the interchange of zealous service. And what if I
also add, as I may fairly do, thatnothing so allures and attracts
anything to itself as likeness does to friendship? Then it surely will
be granted as a fact that good men love and join themselves to other
good men, in aunion which is almost that of relationship andnature.
For there isnothing more eager or more greedy thannature for what is
like itself. Wherefore, because of this very fact, I think it should be
evident, Fannius and Scaevola, that the good have for the good, as if
fromnecessity, a kindly feeling whichnature has made the fountain of
friendship. But this same goodness belongs also to the generality of
men. For virtue isnotunfeeling,unwilling to serve, orproudly
exclusive, but it is her wont toprotect even wholenations and toplan
the best measures for their welfare, which shecertainly wouldnot do if
she disdained the affection of thecommon mass.</p>
<p>And again, it seems to me at any rate, that those whofalsely assume
expediency to be the basis of friendship, take from friendship'schain
its loveliest link. For it isnot so much the material gainprocured
through a friend, as it is his love, and his love alone, that givesus
delight; and that advantage which we derive from him becomes apleasure
only when his service is inspired by an ardent zeal. And it is far from
being true that friendship iscultivated because ofneed; rather, is it
cultivated by those who are most abundantly blessed with wealth and
power and especially with virtue, which is man's best defence; by those
least inneed of another's help; and by those most generous and most
given to acts of kindness. Indeed, I should be inclined to think that it
isnot well for friendsnever toneed anything at all. Wherein, for
example, would any zeal have displayed itself if Scipio hadnever been
inneed of my advice or assistance either at home or abroad? It isnot
thecase, therefore, that friendship attendsupon advantage, but, on the
contrary, that advantage attendsupon friendship.</p>
<p>It will be our duty, then,not to listen to those besotted men of
pleasurewhen they argue about friendship, of which theyunderstand
neither thepracticenor the theory. For whatperson is there, in the
name of gods and men! who would wish to be surrounded byunlimited
wealth and to abound in every material blessing, oncondition that he
loveno one and thatno one love him? Such indeed is the life of tyrants
— a life, I mean, in which therecan beno faith,no affection,no trust
in thecontinuance of goodwill; where every act arouses suspicion and
anxiety and where friendship hasnoplace. Forcan anyone love either
the man whom he fears, or the man by whom he believes himself to be
feared? Yet tyrants arecourtedunder apretence of affection, but only
for a season. For when bychance they have fallen frompower, as they
generally do, then is it known howpoor they were in friends. And this
is illustrated by the remark said to have been made by Tarquin as he was
going into exile: "I have learned what friends of mine are true and what
are false,now that I amno longer able to reward orpunish either."</p>
<p>And yet, such was the haughtiness andperversity of the man that I
wonder if hecould have had anyone as a friend. Now just as the
character of Tarquincouldnotprocure him true friends, so, with many,
theirpower, if it be very great, is a bar to faithful friendships. For
not only is Fortune blind herself, but as a rule she even blinds those
whom she has embraced; and thus they are generally transported beyond
themselves by wantonpride and obstinacy —norcan anything in the world
be more insufferable than one of Fortune's fools. Indeed we may observe
that men, formerly affable in their manners, becomechanged by military
rank, bypower, and byprosperity, spurn their old-time friends and
revel in thenew. But what is more foolish, when men are in the
plenitude of resources, opportunities, and wealth, than toprocure the
other things which moneyprovides — horses, slaves, splendid raiment,
andcostlyplate — andnotprocure friends, who are, if I may say so,
life's best and fairest furniture? And really while they areprocuring
those material things, they knownot for whom they do it,nor for whose
benefit they toil; for such things are theprey of the strongest; but to
every man the tenure of his friendships ever remains settled and sure,
so that even if there should be acontinuance of those things which are,
so to speak, the gratuities of fortune, yet lifeunadorned and
unattended by friendscouldnot bepleasant. But enough on thispoint.</p>
<p>Wenow have to determine in our discussion of friendship what are the
limits and, so to speak, the boundary lines of affection. On thispoint
I observe that three views areusually advanced,none of which I
approve: first, "That we should have the same feeling for our friends
that we have for ourselves"; second, "That our goodwill towards our
friends shouldcorrespond in all respects to their goodwill towardus,"
and third, "That whatever value a manplacesupon himself, the same
value should beplacedupon him by his friends."I donot agree at all
with any of these views. Certainly the first one isnot true which holds
that "as a man feels towards himself, so should he feel towards his
friend." For how many things we do for our friends that wenever would
do for ourselves! At one time we beg and entreat anunworthy man, and
again we assail another too sharply or loudly railupon him — thingsnot
quitecreditable in our own affairs, but exceedingly so in behalf of our
friends; and there arenumerous occasions when good men forgo, orpermit
themselves to be deprived of, manyconveniences in order that their
friends rather than themselves may enjoy them.</p>
<p>The second view limits friendship to an equal interchange of services
and feelings. It surely iscalling friendship to a veryclose andpetty
accounting to require it to keep an exact balance ofcredits and debits.
I think true friendship is richer and more abundant than that and does
notnarrowly scan the reckoning lest itpay out more than it has
received; and thereneed beno fear that some bit of kindness will be
lost, that it will overflow the measure and spillupon the ground, or
that more than is due will bepoured into friendship's bin.</p>
<p>But worst of all is the third limitation, which is that "whatever value
a manplacesupon himself, the same value should beplacedupon him by
his friends." For often in some men either the spirit is too dejected,
or the hope of bettering their fortune is too faint. Therefore, it is
not theprovince of a friend, in such acase, to have the same estimate
of another that the other has of himself, but rather it is his duty to
strive with all his might to arouse his friend'sprostrate soul and lead
it to a livelier hope and into a better train of thought. Hence some
other limitation of true friendship must be fixed, after I have first
stated a view which Scipioused tocondemn in the strongest terms. He
often said thatnoutterancecould be found more at war with friendship
than that of the man who had made this remark: "We should love as if at
some time we were going to hate." And Scipiocouldnot, he said, be
induced to adopt thecommonly accepted belief that this expression was
made by Bias,who wascounted one of the Seven Sages; but he thought that
it was the speech of some abandoned wretch, or schemingpolitician, or
of someone who regarded everything as an instrument to serve his own
selfish ends. For how will it bepossible for anyone to be a friend to a
man who, he believes, may be his foe? Nay, in such acase it will be
necessary also for him to desire andpray that his friend may sin as
often aspossible and thereby give him, as it were, the more handles to
lay hold of; and, again, he will be bound to feel grief,pain and envy
at the good deeds and good fortune of his friends. Wherefore this maxim,
whoever its author, really has the effect of destroying friendship:
rather ought we to have been enjoined to exercise suchcare in forming
friendships that we shouldnever begin to love anyone whom we might
sometimes hate. Indeed, Scipio thought that, even if we had been
unfortunate in ourchoice, we should endure it rather thanplan an
opportunity for a breach.</p>
<p>Therefore, these are the limits which I think ought to be observed,
namely: when thecharacters of friends are blameless, then there should
be between themcomplete harmony of opinions and inclinations in
everything without any exception; and, even if by somechance the wishes
of a friend arenot altogether honourable and require to be forwarded in
matters which involve his life or reputation, we should turn aside from
the straightpath,provided, however,utter disgrace doesnot follow;for
there are limits to the indulgence whichcan be allowed to friendship.
Nor indeed ought a man either to disregard his reputation, or to
consider the goodwill of hiscountrymen apoor weapon in the battle of
life, though to hunt after it with fawning and flattery is disgraceful;
as to virtue we must byno means abjure it, for it is attended by
regard.</p>
<p>But Scipio — and I often recur to him, my sole authority for a discourse
on friendship — Scipioused tocomplain that men were morepainstaking
in all other things than in friendship; that everybodycould tell how
many goats and sheep he had,but wasunable to tell thenumber of his
friends; and that men tookpains in getting the former, but were
careless inchoosing the latter, and hadnocertain signs, or marks, so
to speak, by which to determine their fitness for friendship. We ought,
therefore, tochoose men who are firm, steadfast andconstant, aclass
of which there is a great dearth; and at the same time it is very hard
tocome to a decision without a trial, while such trialcan only be made
in actual friendship: thus friendship outruns the judgement and takes
away the opportunity of a trial. Hence it is thepart of wisdom tocheck
the headlong rush of goodwill as we would that of achariot, and thereby
so manage friendship that we may in some degreeput the dispositions of
friends, as we do those of horses, to apreliminary test. Some men often
giveproof in apetty money transaction howunstable they are; while
others, whocouldnot have been influenced by a trivial sum, are
discovered in one that is large. But if any shall be found who think it
base toprefer money to friendship, where shall we find those who donot
put office,civil and military rank, highplace andpower, above
friendship, so that when the former advantages areplaced before them on
one side and the latter on the other they willnot muchprefer the
former? For feeble is the struggle of humannature againstpower, and
when men have attained it even by the disregard of friendship they
imagine the sin will be forgotten because friendship wasnot disregarded
without a weightycause. Therefore, true friendships are very hard to
find among those whose time is spent in office or in business of a
public kind. For wherecan you find a man so high-minded as toprefer
his friend's advancement to his own? And,passing by material
considerations,prayconsider this: how grievous and how hard to most
persons does association in another's misfortunes appear! Nor is it easy
to find men who will go down tocalamity's depths for a friend. Ennius,
however, is right when he says: When Fortune's fickle the faithful
friend is found; yet it is on these twocharges that most men are
convicted of fickleness: they either hold a friend of little value when
their own affairs areprosperous, or they abandon him when his are
adverse. Whoever, therefore, in either of thesecontingencies, has shown
himself staunch, immovable, and firm in friendship ought to be
considered to belong to thatclass of men which is exceedingly rare —
aye, almost divine.</p>
<p>Now the support and stay of thatunswervingconstancy, which we look for
in friendship, is loyalty; fornothing isconstant that is disloyal.
Moreover, the rightcourse is tochoose for a friend one who is frank,
sociable, and sympathetic — that is, one who is likely to be influenced
by the same motives as yourself — since all these qualitiesconduce to
loyalty; for it is impossible for a man to be loyal whosenature is full
of twists and twinings;and, indeed, one who isuntouched by the same
influences as yourself and isnaturallyunsympatheticcannot be either
loyal or steadfast. To this observation should be added a requirement
tending toproduce that steadfastness, which I have been discussing for
some time: a friend mustneither takepleasure in bringingcharges
against younor believe them when made by others. And so, the truth of
what I said in the beginning is established: "Friendshipcannot exist
except among good men."</p>
<p>For it ischaracteristic of the good man, whom I may alsocall the wise
man, to maintain these two rules in friendship: first, let there beno
feigning or hypocrisy; for it is more befitting acandid man to hate
openly than to mask his real thoughts with a lying face; secondly, let
himnot only rejectchargespreferred by another, but also let him avoid
even being suspicious and ever believing that his friend has done
something wrong. To this should be added acertain affability of speech
and manner, which givesno mean flavour to friendship. Whileunvarying
seriousness and gravity are indeed impressive, yet friendship ought to
be moreunrestrained, genial, and agreeable, and more inclined to be
whollycourteous andurbane.</p>
<p>But at thispoint there arises acertain question of some little
difficulty: Arenew friends who are worthy of friendship, at any time to
bepreferred to old friends, as we are wont toprefer young horses to
old ones? The doubt isunworthy of a human being, for there should beno
surfeit of friendships as there is of other things; and, as in thecase
of wines that improve with age, the oldest friendships ought to be the
most delightful; moreover, the well-known adage is true: "Men must eat
many apeck of salt together before theclaims of friendship are
fulfilled."Butnew friendships arenot to be scorned if they offer hope
of bearing fruit, like green shoots ofcorn º that donot disappointus
at harvest-time; yet the old friendships mustpreserve their ownplace,
for the force of age and habit is very great. Nay, even in thecase of
the horse justnow referred to, everybody,nothingpreventing, would
ratheruse one to which he has grown accustomed than one that is
untrained andnew. And habit is strong in thecasenot only of animate,
but also of inanimate things, since we delight even inplaces, though
rugged and wild, in which we have lived for a fairly long time.</p>
<p>But it is of theutmost importance in friendship that superior and
inferior should stand on an equality. For oftentimes acertain
pre-eminence does exist, as was that of Scipio in what I maycall "our
set." But henever affected any superiority over Philus, or Rupilius, or
Mummius, or over his other friends of a lower rank. For example, his
brother Quintus Maximus, a distinguished man,no doubt, though byno
means his equal, was treated by him as a superior, because he was older
than himself. Indeed Scipio desired that he might be thecause of
enhancing the dignity of all his friends. And thiscourse every man
should adopt and imitate, so that if he is endowed with any superiority
in virtue, intellect, or fortune he may impart it to his relatives and
share it with hisnext of kin; or if, for example, hisparents are of a
lowly station and his relatives are less favoured in mind or estate than
himself, he may increase the means of the one and be the source of
honour and influence to other; as in legends, men who have for a long
time lived the life of menials, because their lineage and family were
unknown, although discovered and found to be the sons of gods or of
kings,nevertheless retain affection for the shepherds whom for many
years they regarded as theirparents. And surely such a feeling ought to
be much stronger in thecase of real andundoubtedparents. For the
fruit of genius, of virtue, and, indeed, of every excellence, imparts
its sweetest flavour when bestowed on those who arenearest and dearest
tous. As, therefore, in the intimacy existing between friends and
relatives the superior shouldput himself on a level with his inferior,
so the latter oughtnot to grieve that he is surpassed by the former in
intellect, fortune, orposition. But many of the latter kind are
continuallyuttering somecomplaints or reproaches even, especially if
they think that they have done anything which theycan speak of as an
act of duty and of friendship, involving acertain amount of toil. A
very disagreeableclass ofpeople,certainly, are those who are ever
obtruding their own services, which ought to be kept in mind by him for
whom they wereperformed and shouldnot be mentioned by him who
performed them. As, therefore, in friendship, those who are superior
should lower themselves, so, in a measure, should they liftup their
inferiors. For there arecertain men who render friendships disagreeable
by thinking themselves slighted — a thing which rarely happens, except
in thecase ofpersons who think that they really deserve to be
slighted; but they ought to be relieved of such an opinionnot by words
only but by action. Now, in the firstplace, you must render to each
friend as much aid as youcan, and, in the secondplace, as much as he
whom you love and assist has thecapacity to bear. For however eminent
you may be, youcannot lead all your friends through the various grades
to the highest official rank, as Scipio was able to do when he made
Publius Rupilius Rupilius ')" onmouseout="nd();"> ºconsul, though he
couldnot accomplish this result in thecase of his brother, Lucius
Rupilius. º But even if youcould bestowupon another any honour you
chose, yet you mustconsider what he is able to bear.</p>
<p>As a rule decisions about friendships should be formed after strength
and stability have been reached in mind and age;nor should men who in
boyhood were devoted to hunting and games of ball, keep as their
intimates those whom they loved at thatperiod simply because they were
fond of the samepursuits. For on thatprinciplenurses and the slaves
who attendedus to and from school, will, by right ofpriority of
acquaintance,claim the largest share of our goodwill. I admit that they
arenot to beneglected, but they are to be regarded in an entirely
different way;underno otherconditionscan friendship remain secure.
For difference ofcharacter is attended by difference of taste that
severs friendships;nor is there any othercause why good mencannot be
friends to wicked men, or wicked men to good men, except that there is
the greatestpossible distance between them incharacter and in taste.</p>
<p>This rule also mayproperly beprescribed in friendship: Letnot a sort
ofungoverned goodwill (as very frequently happens) hinder your friends'
advantage in important matters. For indeed, if I may go back to legends,
Neoptolemuscouldnot have taken Troy if he had been willing to listen
to Lycomedes, by whom he had been reared and who endeavoured with many
tears to hinder him from setting out. Often, too, important duties arise
which require the temporary separation of friends; and he who would
hinder the discharge of those duties because hecannot easily bear his
grief at the absence of friends, isnot only weak and effeminate, but,
on that very account, is far from reasonable in his friendship. In
brief, it is your duty on every occasion toconsidercarefully both what
you will demand from a friend and what you willpermit him to obtain
when he makes a demand on you.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a sort of disaster inconnexion with breaking off
friendships — fornow our discussion descends from the intimacies of the
wise to friendships of the ordinary kind— which is sometimes
unavoidable. There are often in friends outbreaks of vice which affect
sometimes their actual friends, sometimes strangers, yet so that the
infamy of the evil flows over on to the friends. Therefore the ties of
such friendships should be sundered by a gradual relaxation of intimacy,
and, as I have heard that Catoused to say, "They should beunravelled
rather than rent apart,"unless there has been some outbreak ofutterly
unbearable wrongdoing, so that the onlycourseconsistent with rectitude
and honour, and indeed the only onepossible, is to effect an immediate
withdrawal of affection and association.</p>
<p>But if, on the other hand, asusually happens, a merechange of
disposition and of tastes should occur, or if a difference inpolitical
views should arise (for I am talkingnow, as I said a moment ago,not of
friendships existing between wise men, but of those of the ordinary
kind),care must be taken lest it appear,not only that friendship has
beenput aside, but that open hostility has been aroused. Fornothing is
more discreditable than to be at war with one with whom you have lived
on intimate terms. Scipio, as you both know, had severed his friendship
with Quintus Pompeius on my account;and, moreover, because of a
disagreement inpolitics, was estranged from mycolleague, Metellus; he
acted with deliberation and moderation in each instance, and without any
bitter feeling of resentment. Wherefore, in the firstplace,pains must
be taken that, ifpossible,no discord should arise between friends, but
incase it does, then ourcare should be that the friendships appear to
have burned out rather than to have been stamped out. And you must
indeed be on your guard lest friendships bechanged into serious
enmities, which are the source of disputes, abuse, and invective. Yet
even these, if endurable, are to be borne, and such respect is to be
paid to the old-time friendship that he may be in the wrong who
committed the offence andnot he who suffered it.</p>
<p>In short: there is but one security and oneprovision against these ills
and annoyances, and that is,neither to enlist your love too quicklynor
to fix it onunworthy men. Now they are worthy of friendship who have
within their own souls the reason for their being loved. A rareclass
indeed! And really everything splendid is rare, andnothing is harder to
find than something which in all respects is aperfect specimen of its
kind. But the majority of men recognizenothing whatever in human
experience as goodunless it brings someprofit and they regard their
friends as they do theircattle, valuing most highly those which give
hope of the largest gain. Thus do they fail to attain that loveliest,
most spontaneous friendship, which is desirable in and for itself; and
they donot learn from their own experience what thepower of such
friendship is and are ignorant of itsnature and extent. For everyone
loves himself,not with a view of acquiring someprofit himself from his
self-love, but because he is dear to himself on his own account; and
unless this same feeling were transferred to friendship, the real friend
wouldnever be found; for he is, as it were, another self.</p>
<p>Now if it is evident in animals, whether of the air, the water, or the
land, and whether tame or wild, first, that they love themselves — for
this feeling is born alike in every livingcreature — and, secondly,
that they require and eagerly search for other animals of their own kind
to which they may attach themselves — and this they do with a longing in
some degree resembling human love — then how much more, by the law of
hisnature, is this thecase with man who both loves himself anduses
his reason to seek out another whose soul he may so mingle with his own
as almost to make one out of two!</p>
<p>But most menunreasonably,not to say shamelessly, want a friend to be
such as theycannot be themselves and require from friends what they
themselves donot bestow. But the fair thing is, first of all, to be a
good man yourself and then to seek another like yourself. It is among
such men that this stability of friendship, of which I have been
treating for some time, may be made secure; and whenunited by ties of
goodwill, they will first of all subdue thosepassions to which other
men are slaves; and,next, they will delight in what is equitable and
accords with law, and will go to all lengths for each other; they will
not demand from each other anythingunless it is honourable and just,
and they willnot onlycherish and love, but they will also revere, each
other. For he who takes reverence from friendship, takes away its
brightest jewel. Therefore a fatal mistake is made by those who think
that friendship opens wide the door to everypassion and to every sin.
Friendship was given tous bynature as the handmaid of virtue,not as a
comrade of vice; because virtuecannot attain her highest aims
unattended, but only inunion and fellowship with another. Such a
partnership as this, whether it is, or was, or is yet to be, should be
considered the best and happiestcomradeship along the road tonature's
highest good. In such apartnership, I say, abide all things that men
deem worthy ofpursuit — honour and fame and delightful tranquillity of
mind; so that when these blessings are at hand life is happy, and
without them, itcannot be happy.</p>
<p>Since happiness is our best and highest aim, we must, if we would attain
it, give our attention to virtue, without which wecan obtainneither
friendshipnor any other desirable thing; on the other hand, those who
slight virtue and yet think that they have friends,perceive their
mistake at last when some grievous misfortune forces them toput their
friends to the test. Therefore, I repeat the injunction, for it should
be said again and again: you should love your friend after you have
appraised him; you shouldnot appraise him after you have begun to love
him. But we arepunished for ournegligence in many things, and
especially are we most grievouslypunished for ourcarelessness in the
choice and treatment of our friends; for we deliberate after the event,
and we do what the ancientproverb forbids — we argue thecase after the
verdict is found. Accordingly, after we have become involved with others
in a mutual affection, either by long association or by interchange of
favours, somecause of offence arises and we suddenly break the bonds of
friendship asunder when it has run but half itscourse.</p>
<p>Thereforecarelessness so great in regard to a relation absolutely
indispensable deserves the more to becensured. For the one thing in
human experience about whose advantage all men with one voice agree, is
friendship; even virtue itself is regarded withcontempt by many and is
said to be merepretence and display; many disdain riches, because they
arecontent with little and take delight in meagre fare andplain dress;
political honours, too, for which some have a burning desire — how many
so despise them that they believenothing more empty andnothing more
inane! Likewise other things, which seem to some to be worthy of
admiration, are by many thought to be ofno value at all. Butconcerning
friendship, all, to a man, think the same thing: those who have devoted
themselves topublic life; those who find their joy in science and
philosophy; those who manage their own business free frompubliccares;
and, finally, those who are wholly givenup to sensualpleasures — all
believe that without friendship life isno life at all, or at least they
so believe if they have any desire whatever to live the life of free
men. For itcreeps imperceptibly, I knownot how, into every life, and
suffersno mode of existence to be devoid of itspresence.</p>
<p>Nay, even if anyone were of anature so savage and fierce as to shun and
loathe the society of men — such, for example, as tradition tellsus a
certain Timon of Athens once was — yet even such a mancouldnot refrain
from seeking someperson before whom he mightpour out the venom of his
embittered soul. Moreover, the view just expressed might best be
appraised if such a thing as thiscould happen: suppose that a god
should removeus from these haunts of men andputus in some solitary
place, and, whileprovidingus there inplenteous abundance with all
material things for which ournature yearns, should take fromus
altogether thepower to gazeupon our fellow men — who would be such a
man of iron as to be able to endure that sort of a life? And who is
there from whom solitude wouldnot snatch the enjoyment of every
pleasure?True, therefore, is thatcelebrated saying of Archytas of
Tarentum, I think it was — a saying which I have heard repeated by our
old men who in their turn heard it from their elders. It is to this
effect: "If a man should ascend alone into heaven and beholdclearly the
structure of theuniverse and the beauty of the stars, there would beno
pleasure for him in the awe-inspiring sight, which would have filled him
with delight if he had had someone to whom hecould describe what he had
seen." Thusnature, lovingnothing solitary, always strives for some
sort of support, and man's best support is a very dear friend.</p>
<p>But though this samenature declares by so manyutterances what she
wishes, what she seeks, and what she ardently longs for, yet we somehow
grow deaf and donot hearken to her voice. For varied andcomplex are
the experiences of friendship, and they afford manycauses for suspicion
and offence, which it is wise sometimes to ignore, sometimes to make
light of, and sometimes to endure. But there is onecause of offence
which must be encountered in order that both theusefulness and loyalty
of friendship may bepreserved; for friends frequently must benot only
advised, but also rebuked, and both advice and rebuke should be kindly
received when given in a spirit of goodwill. But somehow it is true, as
put by my intimate friend in his Andria:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Complaisance getsus friends,plain speaking, hate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A troublesome thing is truth, if it is indeed the source of hate, which
poisons friendship; but much more troublesome iscomplaisance, which, by
showing indulgence to the sins of a friend, allows him to becarried
headlong away; but the greatest fault is in him who both scornfully
rejects truth and is driven bycomplaisance to ruin.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this entire matter reason andcare must beused, first,
that advice be free from harshness, and second, that reproof be free
from insult. But in showingcomplaisance — I am glad to adopt Terence's
word, obsequium — letcourtesy be at hand, and let flattery, the
handmaid of vice, be far removed, as it isunworthynot only of a friend
but even of a free man; for we live in one way with a tyrant and in
another with a friend. Now we must despair of the safety of the man
whose ears are soclosed to truth that hecannot hear what is true from
a friend. For there is shrewdness in that well-known saying of Cato, as
there was in much that he said: "Some men are better served by their
bitter-tongued enemies than by their sweet-smiling friends; because the
former often tell the truth, the latter,never." And furthermore, it is
absurd that men who are admonished donot feel vexation at what ought to
vex them, but do feel it at what oughtnot; for they are annoyed,not at
the sin, but at the reproof; whereas, on thecontrary, they ought to
grieve for the offence and rejoice at itscorrection.</p>
<p>As, therefore, it ischaracteristic of true friendship both to give and
to receive advice and, on the one hand, to give it with all freedom of
speech, but without harshness, and on the other hand, to receive it
patiently, but without resentment, sonothing is to beconsidered a
greater bane of friendship than fawning,cajolery, or flattery; for give
it as manynames as youchoose, it deserves to be branded as a vice
peculiar to fickle and false-hearted men who say everything with a view
topleasure andnothing with a view to truth. Moreover, hypocrisy isnot
only wickedunder allcircumstances, because itpollutes truth and takes
away thepower to discern it, but it is also especially inimical to
friendship, since itutterly destroys sincerity, without which the word
friendshipcan haveno meaning. And since the effect of friendship is to
make, as it were, one soul out of many, how will that bepossible ifnot
even in one man taken by himself shall there be a soul always one and
the same, but fickle,changeable, and manifold?For whatcan be aspliant
and erratic as the soul of the man whochangesnot only to suit
another's humour and desire, but even his expression and hisnod?</p>
<p>&#x3C;divclass="quote"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He says "nay," and "nay" say I; he says "yea," and "yea" say I; in fine,
I bade myself agree with him in everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was said by Terence whom I quoted before, but he says it in the
character of Gnatho; and to have such a man for a friend on any terms is
a mark of inconstancy. However, there are many like Gnatho, though his
superiors in birth, fortune, and reputation, who become dangerous
flatterers when their insincerity is supported by theirposition. But by
the exercise ofcare a fawning friend may be separated and distinguished
from a true friend, just as everythingpretended and false may be
distinguished from what is genuine and true. Apublic assembly, though
composed of very ignorant men,can,nevertheless,usually see the
difference between a demagogue — that is, a smooth-tongued, shallow
citizen — and one who has stability, sincerity, and weight. With what
flattering words Gaius Papiriusnot long ago insinuated himself into the
favour of the assembly, when he was trying tocarry a law making the
people's tribunes eligible for re‑election! I spoke against it — but I
willnot talk of myself, it will give me morepleasure to talk about
Scipio. Ye gods! What weight and majesty there was in his speech on that
occasion! One would have said, without hesitation, that he was the
leader of the Romanpeople,not theircomrade. But you both were
present; besides, his speech ispublished. As a result this "people's
law" was rejected by thepeople's votes.</p>
<p>Again — andpardon me for referring to myself — you remember when Lucius
Mancinus and Scipio's brother, Quintus Maximus, wereconsuls,howpopular
apparently was theproposed law of Gaius Licinius Crassus regarding the
priestly offices — for the right toco‑opt to vacanciespossessed by the
college was beingconverted intopatronage for thepeople. (By the way,
Crassus was the first man to begin thepractice of facing towards the
forum in addressing thepeople.)Nevertheless, through my speech in
reply, reverence for the immortal gods easilyprevailed over the
plausible oration of Crassus. And this tookplace while I waspraetor
and five years before I was electedconsul. Thus thecause was won more
by its own merit than by the influence of one holding a very high
official rank.</p>
<p>Now, if on the stage, I mean on theplatform, where there is the
greatest opportunity for deception and disguise, truth yetprevails,
provided it is madeplain and brought into the light of day, what ought
to be thecase with friendship which is wholly weighed in the scales of
truth? For in friendship,unless, as the saying is, you behold and show
an open heart, youcan haveno loyalty orcertainty andnot even the
satisfaction of loving and of being loved, since you donot know what
true love is. And yet this flattery of which I spoke, however deadly it
may be,can harmno one except him who receives it and delights in it.
It follows that the man who lends the readiest ear to flatterers is the
one who is most given to self-flattery and is most satisfied with
himself.</p>
<p>I grant that Virtue loves herself; for she best knows herself and
realizes how lovable she is; but it isnot virtue I am talking about but
a reputation for virtue. For many wishnot so much to be, as to seem to
be, endowed with real virtue. Such men delight in flattery, and when a
complimentary remark is fashioned to suit their fancy they think the
emptyphrase isproof of their own merits. There isnothing, therefore,
in a friendship in which one of theparties to it doesnot wish to hear
the truth and the other is ready to lie. Nor should we see any humour in
the fawningparasites incomedies if there wereno braggart soldiers. In
truth did Thais send me many thanks?</p>
<p>It would have been enough to answer, "Many." "Millions of them," said
theparasite. The flatterer always magnifies that which the one for
whose gratification he speaks wishes to be large. Wherefore, although
that sort of hollow flattery influences those whocourt and make a bid
for it, yet even stronger and steadier men should be warned to be on
their guard lest they be taken in by flattery of thecrafty kind.</p>
<p>No one, to be sure,unless he is anutter fool, fails to detect the open
flatterer, but we must exercise a watchfulcare against the deep and
crafty one lest he stealuponusunawares. For he is very hard to
recognize, since he often fawns even by opposing, and flatters and
cajoles bypretending to quarrel,until at last he gives in, allowing
himself to be overcome so that his dupe may appear to have seen further
into the matter than himself. And yet, is there anything more
discreditable than to be made a dupe? Ifnot, then we should be all the
more on our guard that it doesnot happen tous to have toconfess:</p>
<p>To-day, of all old fools thatplay thecomicparts, You've wheedled me
the most and made your greatest dupe.</p>
<p>For even on the stage the silliestcharacters take theparts of old men
lacking in foresight and easily deceived.</p>
<p>But in someunaccountable way I have drifted away from the friendship of
faultless men — that is, men of wisdom, such wisdom I mean as is
observed to fall to the lot of man — and I have rambled on to a
discussion of friendships of the frivolous kind. Wherefore, let me
return to the topic with which I began and finallyput an end even to
that.</p>
<p>Virtue, my dear Gaius Fannius, and you, my dear Quintus Mucius, Virtue,
I say, bothcreates the bond of friendship andpreserves it. For in
Virtue iscomplete harmony, in her ispermanence, in her is fidelity;
and what she has raised her head and shown her own light and has seen
and recognized the same light in another, she moves towards it and in
turn receives its beams; as a result love or friendship leaps into
flame; for both words derived from a word meaning "to love."But love is
nothing other than the great esteem and affection felt for him who
inspires that sentiment, and it isnot sought because of materialneed
or for the sake of material gain. Nevertheless even this blossoms forth
from friendship, although you didnot make it your aim.</p>
<p>Because of this friendly impulse, I, as a young man, became attached to
those old men, Lucius Paulus, Marcus Cato, Gaius Gallus, Publius Nasica,
and Tiberius Gracchus, father-in‑law of my dear Scipio. And while that
feeling is stronger between men of the same age, as between Scipio,
Lucius Furius, Publius Rupilius, Spurius Mummius, and myself; yet, in
turn,now that I am old, I findpleasure in the affection of young men,
like yourselves and Quintus Tubero; and I find delight also in social
intercourse with still younger men like Publius Rutilius and Aulus
Verginius. And since it is the law of human life and of humannature
that anew generation is evercoming forth, it is really most desirable,
when youcan, to reach the goal, so to speak, with men of your own age —
those with whom you began the race of life.</p>
<p>But inasmuch as things human are frail and fleeting, we must be ever on
the search for somepersons whom we shall love and who will loveus in
return; for if goodwill and affection are taken away, every joy is taken
from life. For me, indeed, though he was suddenly snatched away, Scipio
still lives and will always live; for it was his virtue thatcaused my
love and that isnot dead. Nor is it only in my sight and for me, who
had itconstantly within my reach, that his virtue lives; it will even
shed its light and splendour on menunborn. No one will everundertake
withcourage and hope the larger tasks of life without thinking that he
mustcontinually keep before him the memory and example of that
illustrious man.</p>
<p>For mypart, of all the blessings that fortune ornature has bestowed on
me, there isnone which Icancompare with Scipio's friendship. In it I
found agreement onpublic questions; in it,counsel inprivate business,
and in it, too, a leisure ofunalloyed delight. And, so far as I was
aware, Inever offended him in even the most trivialpoint;nor did I
ever hear a word from him that Icould wishunsaid; there was one home
forus both; we had the same fare and shared it incommon, and we were
togethernot only in our militarycampaigns, but also in our foreign
tours and on our vacations in thecountry.</p>
<p>Whyneed I speak of ourconstant devotion to investigation and to
learning in which, remote from the gaze of men, we spent all our leisure
time? If my recollection and memory of these things had died with him, I
couldnotnow by any means endure the loss of a man so verynear and
dear to me. But those experiences with him arenot dead; rather they are
nourished and made more vivid by my reflection and memory; and even if I
wereutterly deprived of thepower to recall them, yet my age would of
itself afford me great relief; for Icannot have much longer time to
bear this bereavement; besides, every trial, which is of brief duration,
ought to be endurable, even if it be severe.</p>
<p>This is all that I had to say about friendship; but I exhort you both so
to esteem virtue (without which friendshipcannot exist), that,
excepting virtue, you will thinknothing more excellent than friendship.</p></div><div class="postNav"><div><a href="/sharing-useful-content">Back</a></div><div><a href="/">Home</a></div><div></div></div></div></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/cicero";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"app":["/app-3a44190379e36852cff3.js"],"component---src-templates-all-tags-index-js":["/component---src-templates-all-tags-index-js-78a6a343114b23b22a75.js"],"component---src-templates-single-tag-index-js":["/component---src-templates-single-tag-index-js-27021884fb475374b115.js"],"component---src-templates-blog-post-js":["/component---src-templates-blog-post-js-71f597de70dd04d31c90.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-19d297204b563324174c.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/component---src-templates-blog-post-js-71f597de70dd04d31c90.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-3a44190379e36852cff3.js" async=""></script><script src="/commons-de58d82d212f50c801e6.js" async=""></script><script src="/webpack-runtime-c744068957af8311855b.js" async=""></script></body></html>
