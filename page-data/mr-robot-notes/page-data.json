In this case, the <em><code>dll</code></em> seems to be\n<code>libhd.so</code>.</p>\n<p>He finds that libary's address in memory so that he can manipulate its\nview of the world or to read the data it has saved. This method enables him to spy\non anything the victim types on their keyboard, for example.</p>\n<h2>Weaponization</h2>\n<p><img src=\"../../../static/assets/images/mr_robot_shellcode.png\" alt=\"Weaponization\"></p>\n<p>In this screenshot from <strong>Mr. Robot</strong>, Elliot is injecting <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellcode\"><strong><code>shellcode</code></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal\"><code>hexadecimal</code></a> - a base16\nnumbering system - encoded computer instructions) that <strong>exploit a PDF vulnerability.</strong>\nThe PDF is later to a victim who is compromised after they open the file.</p>\n<h2>Exfiltration</h2>\n<p><img src=\"../../../static/assets/images/mr_robot_keylogger.png\" alt=\"Exfiltration\"></p>\n<p>In this screenshot from <strong>Mr. Robot</strong>, Elliot is reading the <strong>keylogger</strong> data he has stored on the victim's\nmachine in a file called <em><code>/dev/nu11</code></em>. This name is a smart method against Linux victim,\n<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_device\"><strong><code>/dev/null</code></strong></a> is a <strong>\"blackhole\"</strong> -\ndata to ignore can redirect here to avoid printing it to the screen or storing it in a file.</p>\n<p>The most common use case for writing to <strong><code>/dev/null</code></strong> is the data output from a command,\nscript, or application that isn't needed. Elliot is trying to evade notice by writing to\n<em><code>/dev/nu11</code></em> because someone looking for a malicious process may mistakenly believe the\nprocess is writing to <strong><code>/dev/null</code></strong> and not attempt to look because assume it doesn't contain data.\nHe periodically saves data to this file so that he has a history of everything the user types.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Mr Robot Coolness"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"pathSlug":"/mr-robot-notes","prev":null,"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/yubikeys","title":"YubiKeys","tags":["yubico","yubikey","webauthn","fido","phishing","passwordless"]}}}}}
