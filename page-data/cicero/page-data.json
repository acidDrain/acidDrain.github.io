After\nhis death I betook myself to thepontiff, Scaevola, who, both in\nintellect and in integrity, was, I venture to assert, quite the most\ndistinguished man of our State. But of him I shall speak at another\ntime;now I return to the augur.</p>\n<p>Numerous events in the latter's life often recur to me, but the most\nmemorable one of all occurred at his home, as he was sitting, according\nto hiscustom, on a semi-circular garden bench, when I and only a few of\nhis intimate friends were with him, and he happened to fallupon a topic\nwhich, just about that time, was in manypeople's mouths. You, Atticus,\nwere much in the society of Publius Sulpicius, and on that account are\nthe morecertain to remember what great astonishment, or rather\ncomplaining, there was among thepeople when Sulpicius, whileplebeian\ntribune, separated himself in deadly hatred from the thenconsul,\nQuintus Pompeius, with whom he had lived on the most intimate and\naffectionate terms. And so, Scaevola, havingchanced to mention this\nvery fact, thereuponproceeded to repeat tous a discussion on\nfriendship, which Laelius had had with him and with another son-in‑law,\nGaius Fannius, son of Marcus, a few days after the death of Africanus. I\ncommitted the mainpoints of that discussion to memory, and have set\nthem out in thepresent book in my own way; for I have, so to speak,\nbrought the actors themselves on the stage in order to avoid too\nfrequent repetition of \"said I\" and \"said he,\" and tocreate the\nimpression that they arepresent and speaking inperson. For while you\nwerepleading with me again and again to write something on friendship,\nthe subject appealed to me as both worthy of general study, and also\nwell fitted to our intimacy. Therefore I havenot beenunwilling to\nbenefit thepublic at your request. But, as in my Cato the Elder , which\nwas written to you on the subject of old age, I represented Cato, when\nan old man, as theprincipal speaker, because I thoughtno one more\nsuitable to talk of thatperiod of life than he who had been old a very\nlong time and had been a favourite of fortune in old age beyond other\nmen; so, since we had learned from our forefathers that the intimacy of\nGaius Laelius and Publius Scipio was mostnoteworthy, Iconcluded that\nLaelius was a fitperson to expound the very views on friendship which\nScaevola remembered that he had maintained. Besides, discourses of this\nkind seem in some way to acquire greater dignity when founded on the\ninfluence of men of ancient times, especially such as are renowned; and,\nhence, in reading my own work on Old Age I am at times so affected that\nI imagine Cato is the speaker andnot myself. But as in that book I\nwrote as one old man to another old man on the subject of old age, so\nnow in this book I have written as a most affectionate friend to a\nfriend on the subject of friendship. In the former work the speaker was\nCato, whom scarcely any in his day exceeded in age andnone surpassed in\nwisdom; in thepresent treatise the speaker on friendship will be\nLaelius, a wise man (for he was so esteemed), and a man who was\ndistinguished by a glorious friendship. Pleaseput me out of your mind\nfor a little while and believe that Laelius himself is talking. Gaius\nFannius and Quintus Mucius Scaevola havecome to their father-in‑law's\nhouse just after the death of Africanus;theconversation is begun by\nthem and reply is made by Laelius, whose entire discourse is on\nfriendship, and as you read it you will recognize in it aportrait of\nyourself.</p>\n<p>Fannius. What you say is true, Laelius; for there wasno better man than\nAfricanus, andno one more illustrious. But you should realize that all\nmen have fixed their eyes on you alone; you it is whom they bothcall\nand believe to be wise. Recently this title was given to Marcus Cato and\nwe know that Lucius Acilius wascalled \"the Wise\" in our fathers' time,\nbut each of them in a somewhat different way: Acilius because of his\nreputation for skill incivil law; Cato because of his manifold\nexperience, and because of the many well-known instances wherein both in\nSenate and forum he displayed shrewdness of foresight, resolution of\nconduct, or sagacity in reply; and as a result, by the time he had\nreached old age, he bore the title of \"the Wise\" as a sort ofcognomen.\nBut as to yourself, men are wont tocall you wise in a somewhat\ndifferent way,not only because of your mental endowments andnatural\ncharacter, but also because of your devotion to study and because of\nyourculture, and they employ the term in yourcase,not as the ignorant\ndo, but as learned men employ it. And in this sense we haveunderstood\nthatno one in all Greece was \"wise\" except one in Athens, and he,I\nadmit, was actually adjudged \"most wise\" by the oracle of Apollo — for\nthe morecaptiouscritics refuse to admit those who arecalled \"The\nSeven\" into thecategory of the wise. Your wisdom, inpublic estimation,\nconsists in this: youconsider all yourpossessions to be within\nyourself and believe human fortune of less account than virtue. Hence\nthe question isput to me and to Scaevola here, too, I believe, as to\nhow you bear the death of Africanus, and the inquiry is the more\ninsistent because, on the last Nones,when we had met asusual for the\npracticeof our augural act in thecountry home of Decimus Brutus, you\nwerenotpresent, though it had been yourcustom always to observe that\nday and to discharge its duties with the most scrupulouscare.</p>\n<p>Scaevola. There is indeed a great deal of questioning, Gaius Laelius,\njust as Fannius has said, but I state in reply what I have observed:\nthat you bear withcomposure thepain occasioned by the death of one who\nwas at once a most eminent man and your very dear friend; that youcould\nnot beunmoved thereby and that to be so wasnotconsistent with your\nrefined and tendernature and yourculture; but as to yournot attending\nourcollege on the Nones, that, I answer, was due to ill-health andnot\nto grief.</p>\n<p>Laelius. Your reply was excellent, Scaevola, and it wascorrect; forno\npersonal inconvenience of any kind ought to have kept me from the\ndischarge of the duty you mentioned, and which I have alwaysperformed\nwhen I was well,nor do I think itpossible for any event of thisnature\ntocause a man of strongnature toneglect any duty. Now as for your\nsaying, Fannius, that so great merit is ascribed to me — merit such as I\nneither admitnorclaim — you are very kind; but it seems to me that\nyour estimate of Cato is scarcely high enough. For eitherno man was\nwise — which really I think is the better view — or, if anyone, it was\nhe. Putting aside all otherproof,consider how he bore the death of his\nson! I remembered thecase of Paulus, and I had been aconstant witness\nof the fortitude of Gallus, but their sons died in boyhood, while Cato's\nson died in theprime of life when his reputation was assured.\nTherefore, takecarenot to give theprecedence over Cato even to that\nman, whom, as you say, Apollo adjudged the wisest of men; the former is\npraised his deeds, the latter for his words.</p>\n<p>Now, as to myself, let me address you both at once and beg you to\nbelieve that thecase stands thus:If I were to assert that I amunmoved\nby grief at Scipio's death, it would be for \"wise\" men to judge how far\nI am right, yet, beyond a doubt, my assertion would be false. For I am\nindeed moved by the loss of a friend such, I believe, as I shallnever\nhave again, and — as Ican assert onpositive knowledge — a friend such\nasno other man ever was to me. But I amnot devoid of a remedy, and I\nfind very greatconsolation in thecomforting fact that I am free from\nthe delusion whichcauses most men anguish when their friends depart. I\nbelieve thatno ill has befallen Scipio; it has befallen me, if it has\nbefallen anyone; but great anguish for one's own inconveniences is the\nmark of the man who lovesnot his friend but himself.</p>\n<p>But who would say that all hasnot gone wonderfully well with him ? For\nunless he had wished to live for ever — a wish he was very far from\nentertaining — what was there,proper for a human being to wish for,\nthat he didnot attain? The exalted expectation which hiscountry\nconceived of him in hischildhood, he at a bound, through incredible\nmerit, more than realized in his youth. Though henever sought the\nconsulship, he was electedconsul twice — the first timebefore he was of\nlegal age, the second time at aperiod seasonable for him, but almost\ntoo late for the safety of thecommonwealth. And he overthrew the two\ncities that were the deadliest foes of our empire and therebyput an end\nnot only to existing wars, but to future wars as well. Whyneed I speak\nof his most affable manners, of his devotion to his mother, of his\ngenerosity to his sisters,of his kindness to his relatives, of his\nstrict integrity to all men? These things are well known to you both.\nMoreover, how dear he was to the State was indicated by the grief\ndisplayed at his funeral. How, then,could he have gained any advantage\nby the addition of a few more years of life? For even though old age may\nnot be a burden — as I remember Cato, the year before he died,\nmaintained in a discourse with Scipio and myself — yet it does take away\nthat freshness which Scipio kept even to the end.</p>\n<p>Therefore, his life really was such thatnothingcould be added to it\neither by good fortune or by fame; and, besides, the suddenness of his\ndeath took away theconsciousness of dying. It is hard to speak of the\nnature of his death; you both know whatpeople suspect;yet I may say\nwith truth that, of the very many joyous days which he saw in thecourse\nof his life — days thronged to theutmost with admiringcrowds — the\nmost brilliant was the day before he departed this life, when, after the\nadjournment of the Senate, he was escorted home toward evening by the\nConscript Fathers, the Romanpopulace, and the Latin allies, so that\nfrom so lofty a station of human grandeur he seems to havepassed to the\ngods on high rather than to the shades below.</p>\n<p>For I donot agree with those who have recently begun to argue that soul\nand bodyperish at the same time, and that all things are destroyed by\ndeath. I give greater weight to the old-time view, whether it be that of\nour forefathers, whopaid such reverential rites to the dead, which they\nsurely wouldnot have done if they had believed those rites were a\nmatter of indifference to the dead; or, whether it be the view of\nthosewho lived in this land and by theirprinciples andprecepts brought\nculture to Great Greece,whichnow, I admit, is wholly destroyed, but was\nthen flourishing; or, whether it be the view of him who was adjudged by\nthe oracle of Apollo to be the wisest of men, who, though he would argue\non most subjectsnow on one side andnow on the other, yet always\nconsistently maintained that human souls were of God; thatupon their\ndeparture from the body a return to heaven lay open to them, and that in\nproportion as each soul was virtuous and just would the return be easy\nand direct.</p>\n<p>Scipio held this same view, for only a few days before his death, in the\npresence of Philus, Manilius and several others (you were there, too,\nScaevola, having gone with me), he, as if with apremonition of his\nfate, discoursed for three days on thecommonwealth, and devoted almost\nall of theconclusion of the discussion to the immortality of the soul,\nmakinguse of arguments which he had heard, he said, from Africanus the\nElder through a vision in his sleep. If the truth really is that the\nsouls of all good men after death make the easiest escape from what may\nbe termed the imprisonment and fetters of the flesh, whomcan we think\nof as having had an easier journey to the gods than Scipio? Therefore, I\nfear that grief at such a fate as his would be a sign more of envy than\nof friendship. But if, on the other hand, the truth rather is that soul\nand bodyperish at the same time, and thatno sensation remains, then,\nit follows that, as there isnothing good in death, so, of acertainty,\nthere isnothing evil. For if a man has lost sensation the result is the\nsame as if he hadnever been born; and yet the fact that Scipio was born\nis a joy tous and willcause this State to exult so long as it shall\nexist.</p>\n<p>Wherefore, as I have already said, it has gone very well with him, less\nso with me, for, as I was before him in entering life, it had been more\nreasonable to expect that I should have been before him in leaving it.\nStill, such is my enjoyment in the recollection of our friendship that I\nfeel as if my life has been happy because it was spent with Scipio, with\nwhom I shared mypublic andprivatecares; livedunder the same roof at\nhome; served in the samecampaigns abroad, and enjoyed that wherein lies\nthe whole essence of friendship — the mostcomplete agreement inpolicy,\ninpursuits, and in opinions. Hence, I amnot so much delighted by my\nreputation for wisdom which Fannius justnowcalled to mind, especially\nsince it isundeserved, as I am by the hope that the memory of our\nfriendship will always endure; and this thought is the morepleasing to\nme because in the whole range of history only three or fourpairsof\nfriends are mentioned; and I venture to hope that among such instances\nthe friendship of Scipio and Laelius will be known toposterity.</p>\n<p>Fannius. Thatcannot be otherwise, Laelius. But since you have mentioned\nfriendship and we are free frompublic business, it would be very\nagreeable tous — and to Scaevola, too, I hope — if, following your\nusualpractice on other subjects when questionsconcerning them areput\nto you, you would discuss friendship and giveus your opinion as to its\ntheory andpractice.</p>\n<p>Scaevola. Indeed it will be agreeable to me, and, in fact, I was about\nto make the same request when Fannius forestalled me. Hence your\ncompliance will be very agreeable tous both.</p>\n<p>Laelius. Icertainly should raiseno objection if I feltconfidence in\nmyself, for the subject is anoble one, and we are, as Fannius said,\nfree frompublic business. But who am I? or what skillhave I? What you\nsuggest is a task forphilosophers and, what is more, for Greeks — that\nof discoursing on any subject however suddenly it may beproposed to\nthem. This is a difficult thing to do and requiresno littlepractice.\nTherefore, for a discussion of everythingpossible to be said on the\nsubject of friendship, I advise you to apply to those whoprofess that\nart; all that Ican do is tourge you toput friendship before all\nthings human; fornothing is soconformable tonature andnothing so\nadaptable to our fortunes whether they be favourable or adverse.</p>\n<p>This, however, I do feel first of all — that friendshipcannot exist\nexcept among good men;nor do I go into that too deeply,as is done by\nthosewho, in discussing thispoint with more thanusual accuracy, and it\nmay becorrectly, but with too little view topractical results, say\nthatno one is goodunless he is wise. We may grant that; but they\nunderstand wisdom to be a thing such asno mortal man has yet attained.\nI, however, am bound to look at things as they are in the experience of\neveryday life andnot as they are in fancy or in hope. Nevercould I say\nthat Gaius Fabricius, Manius Curius, and Tiberius Coruncanius, whom our\nancestors adjudged to be wise, were wise by such a standard as that.\nTherefore, let the Sophists keep theirunpopularandunintelligible word\nto themselves, granting only that the men justnamed were good men. They\nwillnot do it though; they will say that goodnesscan bepredicated\nonly of the \"wise\" man. Letus thenproceed \"with our own dull wits,\" as\nthe saying is. Those who so act and so live as to giveproof of loyalty\nanduprightness, of fairness and generosity; who are free from all\npassion,caprice, and insolence, and have great strength ofcharacter —\nmen like those just mentioned — such men letusconsider good, as they\nwere accounted good in life, and also entitled to becalled by that term\nbecause, in as far as that ispossible for man, they follow Nature, who\nis the best guide to good living.</p>\n<p>For it seemsclear to me that we were socreated that betweenus all\nthere exists acertain tie which strengthens with ourproximity to each\nother. Therefore, fellowcountrymen arepreferred to foreigners and\nrelativesa to strangers, for with them Nature herself engenders\nfriendship, but it is one that is lacking inconstancy. For friendship\nexcels relationshipb in this, that goodwill may be eliminated from\nrelationship while from friendship itcannot; since, if you remove\ngoodwill from friendship the veryname of friendship is gone; if you\nremove it from relationship, thename of relationship still remains.\nMoreover, how great thepower of friendship is may mostclearly be\nrecognized from the fact that, incomparison with the infinite ties\nuniting the human race and fashioned by Nature herself, this thing\ncalled friendship has been sonarrowed that the bonds of affection\nalwaysunited twopersons only, or, at most, a few.</p>\n<p>For friendship isnothing else than an accord in all things, human and\ndivine,conjoined with mutual goodwill and affection, and I am inclined\nto think that, with the exception of wisdom,no better thing has been\ngiven to man by the immortal gods. Someprefer riches, some good health,\nsomepower, somepublic honours, and many evenprefer sensualpleasures.\nThis last is the highest aim of brutes; the others are fleeting and\nunstable things and dependent lessupon human foresight thanupon the\nfickleness of fortune. Again, there are those whoplace the \"chief good\"\nin virtue and that is really anoble view; but this very virtue is the\nparent andpreserver of friendship and without virtue friendshipcannot\nexist at all. Toproceed then, letus interpret the word \"virtue\" by the\nfamiliarusage of our everyday life and speech, andnot inpompous\nphrase apply to it theprecise standards whichcertainphilosophersuse;\nand letus include in thenumber of good men those who are soconsidered\n— men like Paulus, Cato, Gallus, Scipio, and Philus — who satisfy the\nordinary standard of life; but letuspass by such men as arenowhere to\nbe found at all.</p>\n<p>Therefore, among men like those just mentioned, friendship offers\nadvantagesalmost beyond anypower to describe. In the firstplace, how\ncan life be what Enniuscalls \"the life worth living,\" if it doesnot\nrepose on the mutual goodwill of a friend? What is sweeter than to have\nsomeone with whom you may dare discuss anything as if you werecommuning\nwith yourself? Howcould your enjoyment in times ofprosperity be so\ngreat if you didnot have someone whose joy in them would be equal to\nyour own? Adversity would indeed be hard to bear, without him to whom\nthe burden would be heavier even than to yourself. In short, all other\nobjects of desire are each, for the mostpart, adapted to a single end —\nriches, for spending; influence, for honour;public office, for\nreputation;pleasures, for sensual enjoyment; and health, for freedom\nfrompain and fulluse of the bodily functions; but friendship embraces\ninnumerable ends; turn where you will it is ever at your side;no\nbarrier shuts it out; it isneveruntimely andnever in the way.\nTherefore, we donotuse theproverbial\"fire and water\" on more\noccasions than weuse friendship. I amnotnow speaking of the ordinary\nandcommonplace friendship — delightful andprofitable as it is — but of\nthatpure and faultless kind, such as was that of the few whose\nfriendships are known to fame. For friendship adds a brighter radiance\ntoprosperity and lessens the burden of adversity by dividing and\nsharing it.</p>\n<p>Seeing that friendship includes very many and very great advantages, it\nundoubtedly excels all other things in this respect, that itprojects\nthe bright ray of hope into the future, and doesnot suffer the spirit\nto grow faint or to fall. Again, he who looksupon a true friend, looks,\nas it were,upon a sort of image of himself. Wherefore friends, though\nabsent, are at hand; though inneed, yet abound; though weak, are\nstrong; and — harder saying still — though dead, are yet alive; so great\nis the esteem on thepart of their friends, the tender recollection and\nthe deep longing that still attends them. These things make the death of\nthe departed seem fortunate and the life of the survivors worthy of\npraise. But if you should take the bond of goodwill out of theuniverse\nno house orcitycould stand,nor would even the tillage of the fields\nabide. If that statement isnotclear, then you mayunderstand how great\nis thepower of friendship and ofconcord from aconsideration of the\nresults of enmity and disagreement. For what house is so strong, or what\nstate so enduring that itcannot beutterly overthrown by animosities\nand division? From this it may be judged how great good there is in\nfriendship. It is said, at any rate, that acertain learned man of\nAgrigentumsang in inspired strain in Greek verse that innature and the\nentireuniverse whatever things are at rest and whatever are in motion\nareunited by friendship and scattered by discord. And indeed this is a\nstatement which all mennot onlyunderstand but also approve. Whenever,\ntherefore, therecomes to light some signal service inundergoing or\nsharing the dangers of a friend, who doesnotproclaim it with the\nloudestpraise? What shouts recently rang through the entire theatre\nduring theperformance of thenewplay, written by my guest and friend,\nMarcus Pacuvius,at the scene where, the king being ignorant which of the\ntwo was Orestes, Pylades, who wished to beput to death instead of his\nfriend, declared, \"I am Orestes,\" while Orestescontinued steadfastly to\nassert, as was the fact, \"I am Orestes!\" Thepeople in the audience rose\nto their feet andcheered this incident in fiction; what, think we,\nwould they have done had it occurred in real life? In thiscase Nature\neasily asserted her ownpower, inasmuch as men approved in another as\nwell done that which theycouldnot do themselves.</p>\n<p>Within the foregoing limits I have, I think, been able to state my\nestimate of friendship; if there is anything more to be said — and I\nbelieve there is a great deal — inquire, if youplease, of those who\nmake a business of such discussions.</p>\n<p>Fannius. But weprefer to inquire of you. I have, it is true, often\nquestioned those men too, and indeed havenot been anunwilling\nlistener, but the thread of your discourse is of a somewhat different\ntexture.</p>\n<p>Scaevola. You would say so with greaterconfidence, Fannius, if you had\nbeenpresent recently in Scipio'scountry home during the discussion on\nthe Republic. What an advocate of justice Laelius was then against the\nelaborate speech of Philus! Fannius. Ah ! but it was an easy thing for\nthe most just of men to defend justice. Scaevola. Well, then, wouldnot\nthe defence of friendship be easy for that man who haspreserved it with\ntheutmost fidelity,constancy, and sense of justice, and thereby gained\nthe greatest renown?</p>\n<p>Laelius . Really you are employing violence; for what matters it what\nmeans you take of forcing me? Forcing me youcertainly are. For it is\nnot only hard, butnot even right, to withstand the earnest requests of\none's sons-in‑law,particularly in a goodcause.</p>\n<p>The oftener, therefore, I reflect on friendship the more it seems to me\nthatconsideration should be given to the question, whether the longing\nfor friendship is felt on account of weakness and want, so that by the\ngiving and receiving of favours one may get from another and in turn\nrepay what he isunable toprocure of himself; or, although this mutual\ninterchange is really inseparable from friendship, whether there isnot\nanothercause, older, more beautiful, and emanating more directly from\nNature herself. For it is love ( amor ), from which the word\n\"friendship\" ( amicitia ) is derived, that leads to the establishing of\ngoodwill. For while it is true that advantages are frequently obtained\neven from those who,under apretence of friendship, arecourted and\nhonoured to suit the occasion; yet in friendship there isnothing false,\nnothingpretended; whatever there is is genuine andcomes of its own\naccord. Wherefore it seems to me that friendship springs rather from\nnature than fromneed, and from an inclination of the soul joined with a\nfeeling of love rather than fromcalculation of how muchprofit the\nfriendship is likely to afford. What this feeling is may beperceived\neven in thecase ofcertain animals, which,up to acertain time, so\nlove their offspring and are so loved by them, that their impulses are\neasily seen. But this is much more evident in man; first, from the\naffection existing betweenchildren andparents, whichcannot be\ndestroyed except by some execrablecrime, and again from that kindred\nimpulse of love, which arises when once we have met someone whose habits\nandcharacter arecongenial with our own; because in him we seem to\nbehold, as it were, a sort of lamp ofuprightness and virtue. For there\nisnothing more lovable than virtue,nothing that more alluresus to\naffection, since on account of their virtue anduprightness we feel a\nsort of affection even for those whom we havenever seen. Is there\nanyone who doesnot dwell with some kindly affection on the memory of\nGaius Fabricius and Manius Curius, though henever saw them? On the\nother hand, is there anyone who doesnot hate Tarquin the Proud, Spurius\nCassius, or Spurius Maelius? Against two leaders we had bitter struggles\nfor the empire of Italy — Pyrrhus and Hannibal; for the former, because\nof hisuprightness, we haveno great enmity; for the latter, because of\nhiscruelty,this State will always entertain hatred.</p>\n<p>Now if the force of integrity is so great that we love it, whether in\nthose we havenever seen, or, more wonderful still, even in an enemy,\nwhat wonder that men's souls are stirred when they think they see\nclearly the virtue and goodness of those with whom aclose intimacy is\npossible? And yet love is further strengthened by the receiving of a\nkindly service, by the evidence of another'scare forus, and bycloser\nfamiliarity, and from all these, when joined to the soul's first impulse\nto love, there springsup, if I may say so, a marvellous glow and\ngreatness of goodwill. Ifpeople think that friendship springs from\nweakness and from apurpose to secure someone through whom we may obtain\nthat which we lack, they assign her, if I may so express it, a lowly\npedigree indeed, and an origin far fromnoble, and they would make her\nthe daughter ofpoverty and want. If this were so, then just in\nproportion as any man judged his resources to be small, would he be\nfitted for friendship; whereas the truth is far otherwise. For to the\nextent that a man reliesupon himself and is so fortified by virtue and\nwisdom that he is dependent onno one andconsiders all hispossessions\nto be within himself, in that degree is he mostconspicuous for seeking\nout andcherishing friendships. Now whatneed did Africanus have of\nme?By Hercules!none at all. And I, assuredly, hadnoneed of him\neither, but I loved him because of acertain admiration for his virtue,\nand he, in turn, loved me, because, it may be, of the fairly good\nopinion which he had of mycharacter; andclose association added to our\nmutual affection. Although many and great advantages did ensue from our\nfriendship, still the beginnings of our love didnot spring from the\nhope of gain. For as men of ourclass generous and liberal,not for the\npurpose of demanding repayment — for we donotput our favours out at\ninterest, but are bynature given to acts of kindness — so we believe\nthat friendship is desirable,not because we are influenced by hope of\ngain, but because its entireprofit is in the love itself.</p>\n<p>From this view those men who, after the manner ofcattle, judge\neverything by the standard ofpleasure, vigorously dissent;nor is it\nstrange; for the raising of the vision to anything lofty,noble and\ndivine is impossible to men who have abased their every thought to a\nthing so lowly and mean. Therefore letus dismiss thesepersons from our\nconversation and letus for ourselves believe that the sentiments of\nlove and of kindly affection spring fromnature, when intimation has\nbeen given of moral worth; for when men haveconceived a longing for\nthis virtue they bend towards it and movecloser to it, so that, by\nfamiliar association with him whom they have begun to love, they may\nenjoy hischaracter, equal him in affection, become readier to deserve\nthan to demand his favours, and vie with him in a rivalry of virtue.\nThus the greatest advantages will be realized from friendship, and its\norigin, being derived fromnature rather than from weakness, will be\nmore dignified and moreconsonant with truth. For on the assumption that\nadvantage is thecement of friendships, if advantage were removed\nfriendships would fall apart; but sincenature isunchangeable,\ntherefore real friendships are eternal. Younow have my views on the\norigin of friendship,unless you have something to say in reply.\nFannius. Pray go on, Laelius, and I answer for my friend here, as I have\nthe right to do, since he is my junior. Scaevola. Well said, Fannius.\nTherefore, letus hear.</p>\n<p>Laelius. Then listen, most worthy gentlemen, to thepoints very\nfrequently mentioned between Scipio and me in our discussions of\nfriendship. Now he, indeed,used to say thatnothing was harder than for\na friendship tocontinue to the very end of life; for it often happened\neither that the friendshipceased to be mutually advantageous, or the\nparties to it didnot entertain the samepolitical views; and that\nfrequently, too, the dispositions of men werechanged, sometimes by\nadversity and sometimes by the increasing burdens of age. And then he\nwould draw an illustration of thisprinciple from the analogy of early\nlife. \"For,\" said he, \"the most ardent attachments of boyhood are often\nlaid aside with the boyish dress;but ifcontinued to the time of\nmanhood, they are broken off, sometimes by rivalry incourtship or\nsometimes by acontest for some advantage, in which both of theparties\nto the friendshipcannot be successful at the same time. But should the\nfriendshipcontinue for a longer time, yet it is often overthrown when a\nstruggle for office happens to arise; for while, with the generality of\nmen, the greatest bane of friendship is the lust for money, with the\nmost worthy men it is the strife forpreferment and glory, and from this\nsource frequently have sprung the deadliest enmities between the dearest\nfriends.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then, too, disagreements of a very seriousnature, andusually\njustifiable, arise from a demandupon friends to do something that is\nwrong, as, for example, to become agents of vice or abettors in\nviolence, and when the demand is refused, however honourable the\nrefusal, it isneverthelesscharged by those to whom thecompliance was\ndenied that the laws of friendship have been disregarded; besides, those\nwho dare demand anything and everything of a friend, by that very demand\nprofess a willingness to do anything whatever for the sake of a friend.\nBy theirceaseless recriminationsnot only are social intimaciesusually\ndestroyed, but also everlasting enmities areproduced. So many dangers\nof this kind,\" he would say, \"hover like evil fates over friendships,\nthat it seems to me to require both wisdom and good luck to escape them\nall.\"</p>\n<p>Wherefore, letus firstconsider, if youplease, how far love ought to\ngo in friendship. Supposing Coriolanus to have had friends, were those\nfriends in duty bound to bear arms with him against theircountry? Or\nought the friends of Vecellinus, or of Maelius, to have supported them\nin their attempts to gain regalpower?As to Tiberius Gracchus, when he\nbegan to stirup revolution against the republic,we saw himutterly\ndeserted by Quintus Tubero and by the friends of his own age. And yet\nGaius Blossius of Cumae, aprotégé of your family,Scaevola,came to me\ntoplead for leniency, because I waspresent as adviser to theconsuls,\nLaenas and Rupilius,and offered, as a reason for mypardoning him, the\nfact that his esteem for Tiberius Gracchus was so great he thought it\nwas his duty to do anything that Tiberius requested him to do. Thereupon\nI inquired, \"Even if he requested you to set fire to the Capitol?\" \"He\nnever would have requested me to do that, ofcourse,\" said he, \"but if\nhe had I should have obeyed.\" You see what an impious remark that was!\nAnd, by heavens! he did all that he said he would do, or rather even\nmore; for he didnot follow, but he directed, the infatuation of\nTiberius Gracchus, and he didnot offer himself as thecomrade in the\nlatter's fury, but as the leader. And so, as a result of his madness,\nbeing in fear of the specialcourt of inquiry, he fled into Asia, joined\nour enemies, andpaid a heavy and righteouspenaltyfor hiscrimes\nagainst the Republic.</p>\n<p>Therefore it isno justification whatever of your sin to have sinned in\nbehalf of a friend; for, since his belief in your virtue induced the\nfriendship, it is hard for that friendship to remain if you have\nforsaken virtue. But if we should resolve that it is right, either to\ngrant our friends whatever they wish, or to get from them whatever we\nwish, then, assuming that we were endowed with truly faultless wisdom,\nno harm would result; but I am speaking of the friends before our eyes,\nof those whom we see, or of men of whom we have record, and who are\nknown to everyday life. It is from men of thisclass our examples should\nbe drawn, butchiefly, I grant you, from those who make thenearest\napproach to wisdom. We read that Aemilius Papus was an intimate friend\nof Gaius Luscinus (so we have received it from our forefathers), that\nthey served together twice asconsuls and werecolleagues in the\nkinship. Again the tradition is that Manius Curius and Tiberius\nCoruncanius were mostclosely associated with them and with each other.\nWell, then, it is impossible forus even to suspect any one of these men\nof importuning a friend for anythingcontrary to good faith or to his\nsolemn oath, or inimical to thecommonwealth. What is theneed of\nasserting in thecase of men like these, that if such a request had been\nmade it wouldnot have been granted, seeing that they were thepurest of\nmen, and moreover, regarded it equally impious to grant and make such a\nrequest? But Tiberius Gracchus did find followers in Gaius Carbo and\nGaius Cato,and he found a follower also in his own brother Gaius, who\nthoughnot very ardent then isnow intensely so. Therefore let this law\nbe established in friendship:neither ask dishonourable things,nor do\nthem, if asked. And dishonourable itcertainly is, andnot to be\nallowed, for anyone toplead in defence of sins in general and\nespecially of those against the State, that hecommitted them for the\nsake of a friend. For, my dear Fannius and Scaevola, we Romans arenow\nplaced in such a situation that it is our duty to keep a sharp look-out\nfor the troubles that may befall our State. Ourpoliticalpractice has\nalready swerved far from the track andcourse marked out forus by our\nancestors. Tiberius Gracchus tried to obtain regalpower — or rather, he\nactually did reign for a few months. Had the Romanpeople ever heard of\nor experienced such a thing before? What his friends and relatives, who\nfollowed him even after his death, did in thecase of Publius ScipioI\ncannot describe without tears. As for Carbo, because of the short time\nsince thepunishment of Tiberius Gracchus,we have borne with him as best\nwecould. Now what is to be expected when Gaius Gracchusbecomes tribune,\nI amnot inclined toprophesy; º however, revolutioncreeps on\nimperceptibly at first but once it has acquired momentum, rushes\nheadlong to ruin. You see how much mischief has beencaused already in\nthe matter of the ballot, first by the Gabinian law,and two years later\nby the Cassian law. I seemnow to see thepeople estranged from the\nSenate and the weightiest affairs of state determined by thecaprice of\nthe mob. For morepeople will learn how to start a revolution than how\nto withstand it.</p>\n<p>Why do I say these things? Because without associatesno one attempts any\nsuch mischiefs. It must, therefore, be enjoinedupon good menthat if by\nanychance they should inadvisedly fall into friendships of this kind,\nthey mustnot think themselves so bound that theycannot withdraw from\nfriends who are sinning in some important matter ofpublicconcern; for\nwicked men, on the other hand, apenalty must be enacted, and assuredly\nit willnot be lighter for the followers than for the leaders in\ntreason. Who was more eminent in Greece than Themistocles, who more\npowerful? But he, after having saved Greece from slavery by his\nleadership in the war with Persia, and after having been banished\nbecause of hisunpopularity, wouldnot submit to the injustice of an\nungratefulcountry, as he was in duty bound to do: he did the same thing\nthat Coriolanus had done among ourpeople twenty years before. Not one\nsingle supportercould be found to aid these men against theircountry;\ntherefore, each took his own life. Hence such alliances of wicked men\nnot only shouldnot beprotected by aplea of friendship, but rather\nthey should be visited with summarypunishment of the severest kind, so\nthatno one may think itpermissible to follow even a friend when waging\nwar against hiscountry. And yet this very thing,considering thecourse\naffairs have begun to take, willprobably happen at some future time; as\nfor me, I amno lessconcerned for what thecondition of the\ncommonwealth will be after my death, than I am for itscondition to‑day.</p>\n<p>Therefore let this be ordained as the first law of friendship: Ask of\nfriends only what is honourable; do for friends only what is honourable\nand without even waiting to be asked; let zeal be everpresent, but\nhesitation absent; dare to give true advice with all frankness; in\nfriendship let the influence of friends who are wisecounsellors be\nparamount, and let that influence be employed in advising,not only with\nfrankness, but, if the occasion demands, even with sternness, and let\nthe advice be followed when given. I say this becausecertain men who, I\nam informed, areconsidered sages in Greece, have approvedcertain\nviews, which, in my opinion, are astonishing (but there isnothing that\nthose men willnotpursue with their subtleties). Some of these men\nteach that too much intimacy in friendships should be avoided, lest it\nbenecessary for one man to be full of anxiety for many; that each one\nofus has business of his own, enough and to spare; that it is annoying\nto be too much involved in the affairs of otherpeople; that it is best\nto hold the reins of friendship as loosely aspossible, so that we may\neither draw themup or slacken them at will; for, they say, an essential\nof a happy life is freedom fromcare, and this the soulcannot enjoy if\none man is, as it were, in travail for many.</p>\n<p>Again, there are others, I am told, who, with even less of human\nfeeling, maintain (and I briefly touched on thispoint justnow) that\nfriendships must be sought for the sake of the defence and aid they give\nandnot out of goodwill and affection; therefore, that those least\nendowed with firmness ofcharacter and strength of body have the\ngreatest longing for friendship; andconsequently, that helpless women,\nmore than men, seek its shelter, thepoor more than the rich, and the\nunfortunate more than those who are accounted fortunate. Onoble\nphilosophy! Why, they seem to take the sun out of theuniverse when they\ndeprive life of friendship, than which we have from the immortal godsno\nbetter,no more delightful boon. For of what value is their vaunted\n\"freedom fromcare\"? In appearance it is indeed an alluring thing, but\nin reality often to be shunned. For it is inconsistentnot toundertake\nany honourable business orcourse ofconduct, or to lay it aside when\nundertaken, in order to avoid anxiety. Nay, if wecontinually flee from\ntrouble, we must also flee from Virtue, whonecessarily meets with some\ntrouble in rejecting and loathing thingscontrary to herself, as when\nkindness rejects ill-will, temperance lust, and braverycowardice. And\nso you may see that it is the just who are mostpained at injustice, the\nbrave atcowardice, the self-restrained atprofligacy. It is, therefore,\ncharacteristic of the well-ordered mind both to rejoice at good deeds\nand to bepained at the reverse.</p>\n<p>Wherefore, if distress of mind befalls a wise man (as itcertainly does\nunless we assume that human sympathy has been rooted out of his heart),\nwhy should we remove friendship entirely from our lives in order that we\nmay sufferno worries on its account? For when the soul is deprived of\nemotion, what difference is there — I donot say between man and the\nbeasts of the field, but between man and a stock or a stone, or any such\nthing? Nor are we to listen to those menwho maintain that virtue is hard\nandunyielding and is, as it were, something made of iron; whereas, in\nmany relations of life, and especially in friendship, it is sopliable\nand elastic that it expands, so to speak, with a friend'sprosperity and\ncontracts with his adversity. Wherefore, that mental anguish of which I\nspoke and which often must be felt on a friend's account, hasno more\npower to banish friendship from life than it has tocauseus to reject\nvirtue because virtue entailscertaincares and annoyances.</p>\n<p>But, since, as I said before, virtue knits friendship together, if there\nshould be some exhibition of shining virtue to which a kindred spirit\nmay attach and adjust itself, then, when that happens, love mustneeds\nspring forth. For is there anything so absurd as to delight in many\ninanimate things, likepublic office, fame, and stately buildings, or\ndress andpersonal adornment, and to take little orno delight in a\nsentient being endowed with virtue andcapable of loving, and — if I may\nso term it — of loving back?Fornothing gives morepleasure than the\nreturn of goodwill and the interchange of zealous service. And what if I\nalso add, as I may fairly do, thatnothing so allures and attracts\nanything to itself as likeness does to friendship? Then it surely will\nbe granted as a fact that good men love and join themselves to other\ngood men, in aunion which is almost that of relationship andnature.\nFor there isnothing more eager or more greedy thannature for what is\nlike itself. Wherefore, because of this very fact, I think it should be\nevident, Fannius and Scaevola, that the good have for the good, as if\nfromnecessity, a kindly feeling whichnature has made the fountain of\nfriendship. But this same goodness belongs also to the generality of\nmen. For virtue isnotunfeeling,unwilling to serve, orproudly\nexclusive, but it is her wont toprotect even wholenations and toplan\nthe best measures for their welfare, which shecertainly wouldnot do if\nshe disdained the affection of thecommon mass.</p>\n<p>And again, it seems to me at any rate, that those whofalsely assume\nexpediency to be the basis of friendship, take from friendship'schain\nits loveliest link. For it isnot so much the material gainprocured\nthrough a friend, as it is his love, and his love alone, that givesus\ndelight; and that advantage which we derive from him becomes apleasure\nonly when his service is inspired by an ardent zeal. And it is far from\nbeing true that friendship iscultivated because ofneed; rather, is it\ncultivated by those who are most abundantly blessed with wealth and\npower and especially with virtue, which is man's best defence; by those\nleast inneed of another's help; and by those most generous and most\ngiven to acts of kindness. Indeed, I should be inclined to think that it\nisnot well for friendsnever toneed anything at all. Wherein, for\nexample, would any zeal have displayed itself if Scipio hadnever been\ninneed of my advice or assistance either at home or abroad? It isnot\nthecase, therefore, that friendship attendsupon advantage, but, on the\ncontrary, that advantage attendsupon friendship.</p>\n<p>It will be our duty, then,not to listen to those besotted men of\npleasurewhen they argue about friendship, of which theyunderstand\nneither thepracticenor the theory. For whatperson is there, in the\nname of gods and men! who would wish to be surrounded byunlimited\nwealth and to abound in every material blessing, oncondition that he\nloveno one and thatno one love him? Such indeed is the life of tyrants\n— a life, I mean, in which therecan beno faith,no affection,no trust\nin thecontinuance of goodwill; where every act arouses suspicion and\nanxiety and where friendship hasnoplace. Forcan anyone love either\nthe man whom he fears, or the man by whom he believes himself to be\nfeared? Yet tyrants arecourtedunder apretence of affection, but only\nfor a season. For when bychance they have fallen frompower, as they\ngenerally do, then is it known howpoor they were in friends. And this\nis illustrated by the remark said to have been made by Tarquin as he was\ngoing into exile: \"I have learned what friends of mine are true and what\nare false,now that I amno longer able to reward orpunish either.\"</p>\n<p>And yet, such was the haughtiness andperversity of the man that I\nwonder if hecould have had anyone as a friend. Now just as the\ncharacter of Tarquincouldnotprocure him true friends, so, with many,\ntheirpower, if it be very great, is a bar to faithful friendships. For\nnot only is Fortune blind herself, but as a rule she even blinds those\nwhom she has embraced; and thus they are generally transported beyond\nthemselves by wantonpride and obstinacy —norcan anything in the world\nbe more insufferable than one of Fortune's fools. Indeed we may observe\nthat men, formerly affable in their manners, becomechanged by military\nrank, bypower, and byprosperity, spurn their old-time friends and\nrevel in thenew. But what is more foolish, when men are in the\nplenitude of resources, opportunities, and wealth, than toprocure the\nother things which moneyprovides — horses, slaves, splendid raiment,\nandcostlyplate — andnotprocure friends, who are, if I may say so,\nlife's best and fairest furniture? And really while they areprocuring\nthose material things, they knownot for whom they do it,nor for whose\nbenefit they toil; for such things are theprey of the strongest; but to\nevery man the tenure of his friendships ever remains settled and sure,\nso that even if there should be acontinuance of those things which are,\nso to speak, the gratuities of fortune, yet lifeunadorned and\nunattended by friendscouldnot bepleasant. But enough on thispoint.</p>\n<p>Wenow have to determine in our discussion of friendship what are the\nlimits and, so to speak, the boundary lines of affection. On thispoint\nI observe that three views areusually advanced,none of which I\napprove: first, \"That we should have the same feeling for our friends\nthat we have for ourselves\"; second, \"That our goodwill towards our\nfriends shouldcorrespond in all respects to their goodwill towardus,\"\nand third, \"That whatever value a manplacesupon himself, the same\nvalue should beplacedupon him by his friends.\"I donot agree at all\nwith any of these views. Certainly the first one isnot true which holds\nthat \"as a man feels towards himself, so should he feel towards his\nfriend.\" For how many things we do for our friends that wenever would\ndo for ourselves! At one time we beg and entreat anunworthy man, and\nagain we assail another too sharply or loudly railupon him — thingsnot\nquitecreditable in our own affairs, but exceedingly so in behalf of our\nfriends; and there arenumerous occasions when good men forgo, orpermit\nthemselves to be deprived of, manyconveniences in order that their\nfriends rather than themselves may enjoy them.</p>\n<p>The second view limits friendship to an equal interchange of services\nand feelings. It surely iscalling friendship to a veryclose andpetty\naccounting to require it to keep an exact balance ofcredits and debits.\nI think true friendship is richer and more abundant than that and does\nnotnarrowly scan the reckoning lest itpay out more than it has\nreceived; and thereneed beno fear that some bit of kindness will be\nlost, that it will overflow the measure and spillupon the ground, or\nthat more than is due will bepoured into friendship's bin.</p>\n<p>But worst of all is the third limitation, which is that \"whatever value\na manplacesupon himself, the same value should beplacedupon him by\nhis friends.\" For often in some men either the spirit is too dejected,\nor the hope of bettering their fortune is too faint. Therefore, it is\nnot theprovince of a friend, in such acase, to have the same estimate\nof another that the other has of himself, but rather it is his duty to\nstrive with all his might to arouse his friend'sprostrate soul and lead\nit to a livelier hope and into a better train of thought. Hence some\nother limitation of true friendship must be fixed, after I have first\nstated a view which Scipioused tocondemn in the strongest terms. He\noften said thatnoutterancecould be found more at war with friendship\nthan that of the man who had made this remark: \"We should love as if at\nsome time we were going to hate.\" And Scipiocouldnot, he said, be\ninduced to adopt thecommonly accepted belief that this expression was\nmade by Bias,who wascounted one of the Seven Sages; but he thought that\nit was the speech of some abandoned wretch, or schemingpolitician, or\nof someone who regarded everything as an instrument to serve his own\nselfish ends. For how will it bepossible for anyone to be a friend to a\nman who, he believes, may be his foe? Nay, in such acase it will be\nnecessary also for him to desire andpray that his friend may sin as\noften aspossible and thereby give him, as it were, the more handles to\nlay hold of; and, again, he will be bound to feel grief,pain and envy\nat the good deeds and good fortune of his friends. Wherefore this maxim,\nwhoever its author, really has the effect of destroying friendship:\nrather ought we to have been enjoined to exercise suchcare in forming\nfriendships that we shouldnever begin to love anyone whom we might\nsometimes hate. Indeed, Scipio thought that, even if we had been\nunfortunate in ourchoice, we should endure it rather thanplan an\nopportunity for a breach.</p>\n<p>Therefore, these are the limits which I think ought to be observed,\nnamely: when thecharacters of friends are blameless, then there should\nbe between themcomplete harmony of opinions and inclinations in\neverything without any exception; and, even if by somechance the wishes\nof a friend arenot altogether honourable and require to be forwarded in\nmatters which involve his life or reputation, we should turn aside from\nthe straightpath,provided, however,utter disgrace doesnot follow;for\nthere are limits to the indulgence whichcan be allowed to friendship.\nNor indeed ought a man either to disregard his reputation, or to\nconsider the goodwill of hiscountrymen apoor weapon in the battle of\nlife, though to hunt after it with fawning and flattery is disgraceful;\nas to virtue we must byno means abjure it, for it is attended by\nregard.</p>\n<p>But Scipio — and I often recur to him, my sole authority for a discourse\non friendship — Scipioused tocomplain that men were morepainstaking\nin all other things than in friendship; that everybodycould tell how\nmany goats and sheep he had,but wasunable to tell thenumber of his\nfriends; and that men tookpains in getting the former, but were\ncareless inchoosing the latter, and hadnocertain signs, or marks, so\nto speak, by which to determine their fitness for friendship. We ought,\ntherefore, tochoose men who are firm, steadfast andconstant, aclass\nof which there is a great dearth; and at the same time it is very hard\ntocome to a decision without a trial, while such trialcan only be made\nin actual friendship: thus friendship outruns the judgement and takes\naway the opportunity of a trial. Hence it is thepart of wisdom tocheck\nthe headlong rush of goodwill as we would that of achariot, and thereby\nso manage friendship that we may in some degreeput the dispositions of\nfriends, as we do those of horses, to apreliminary test. Some men often\ngiveproof in apetty money transaction howunstable they are; while\nothers, whocouldnot have been influenced by a trivial sum, are\ndiscovered in one that is large. But if any shall be found who think it\nbase toprefer money to friendship, where shall we find those who donot\nput office,civil and military rank, highplace andpower, above\nfriendship, so that when the former advantages areplaced before them on\none side and the latter on the other they willnot muchprefer the\nformer? For feeble is the struggle of humannature againstpower, and\nwhen men have attained it even by the disregard of friendship they\nimagine the sin will be forgotten because friendship wasnot disregarded\nwithout a weightycause. Therefore, true friendships are very hard to\nfind among those whose time is spent in office or in business of a\npublic kind. For wherecan you find a man so high-minded as toprefer\nhis friend's advancement to his own? And,passing by material\nconsiderations,prayconsider this: how grievous and how hard to most\npersons does association in another's misfortunes appear! Nor is it easy\nto find men who will go down tocalamity's depths for a friend. Ennius,\nhowever, is right when he says: When Fortune's fickle the faithful\nfriend is found; yet it is on these twocharges that most men are\nconvicted of fickleness: they either hold a friend of little value when\ntheir own affairs areprosperous, or they abandon him when his are\nadverse. Whoever, therefore, in either of thesecontingencies, has shown\nhimself staunch, immovable, and firm in friendship ought to be\nconsidered to belong to thatclass of men which is exceedingly rare —\naye, almost divine.</p>\n<p>Now the support and stay of thatunswervingconstancy, which we look for\nin friendship, is loyalty; fornothing isconstant that is disloyal.\nMoreover, the rightcourse is tochoose for a friend one who is frank,\nsociable, and sympathetic — that is, one who is likely to be influenced\nby the same motives as yourself — since all these qualitiesconduce to\nloyalty; for it is impossible for a man to be loyal whosenature is full\nof twists and twinings;and, indeed, one who isuntouched by the same\ninfluences as yourself and isnaturallyunsympatheticcannot be either\nloyal or steadfast. To this observation should be added a requirement\ntending toproduce that steadfastness, which I have been discussing for\nsome time: a friend mustneither takepleasure in bringingcharges\nagainst younor believe them when made by others. And so, the truth of\nwhat I said in the beginning is established: \"Friendshipcannot exist\nexcept among good men.\"</p>\n<p>For it ischaracteristic of the good man, whom I may alsocall the wise\nman, to maintain these two rules in friendship: first, let there beno\nfeigning or hypocrisy; for it is more befitting acandid man to hate\nopenly than to mask his real thoughts with a lying face; secondly, let\nhimnot only rejectchargespreferred by another, but also let him avoid\neven being suspicious and ever believing that his friend has done\nsomething wrong. To this should be added acertain affability of speech\nand manner, which givesno mean flavour to friendship. Whileunvarying\nseriousness and gravity are indeed impressive, yet friendship ought to\nbe moreunrestrained, genial, and agreeable, and more inclined to be\nwhollycourteous andurbane.</p>\n<p>But at thispoint there arises acertain question of some little\ndifficulty: Arenew friends who are worthy of friendship, at any time to\nbepreferred to old friends, as we are wont toprefer young horses to\nold ones? The doubt isunworthy of a human being, for there should beno\nsurfeit of friendships as there is of other things; and, as in thecase\nof wines that improve with age, the oldest friendships ought to be the\nmost delightful; moreover, the well-known adage is true: \"Men must eat\nmany apeck of salt together before theclaims of friendship are\nfulfilled.\"Butnew friendships arenot to be scorned if they offer hope\nof bearing fruit, like green shoots ofcorn º that donot disappointus\nat harvest-time; yet the old friendships mustpreserve their ownplace,\nfor the force of age and habit is very great. Nay, even in thecase of\nthe horse justnow referred to, everybody,nothingpreventing, would\nratheruse one to which he has grown accustomed than one that is\nuntrained andnew. And habit is strong in thecasenot only of animate,\nbut also of inanimate things, since we delight even inplaces, though\nrugged and wild, in which we have lived for a fairly long time.</p>\n<p>But it is of theutmost importance in friendship that superior and\ninferior should stand on an equality. For oftentimes acertain\npre-eminence does exist, as was that of Scipio in what I maycall \"our\nset.\" But henever affected any superiority over Philus, or Rupilius, or\nMummius, or over his other friends of a lower rank. For example, his\nbrother Quintus Maximus, a distinguished man,no doubt, though byno\nmeans his equal, was treated by him as a superior, because he was older\nthan himself. Indeed Scipio desired that he might be thecause of\nenhancing the dignity of all his friends. And thiscourse every man\nshould adopt and imitate, so that if he is endowed with any superiority\nin virtue, intellect, or fortune he may impart it to his relatives and\nshare it with hisnext of kin; or if, for example, hisparents are of a\nlowly station and his relatives are less favoured in mind or estate than\nhimself, he may increase the means of the one and be the source of\nhonour and influence to other; as in legends, men who have for a long\ntime lived the life of menials, because their lineage and family were\nunknown, although discovered and found to be the sons of gods or of\nkings,nevertheless retain affection for the shepherds whom for many\nyears they regarded as theirparents. And surely such a feeling ought to\nbe much stronger in thecase of real andundoubtedparents. For the\nfruit of genius, of virtue, and, indeed, of every excellence, imparts\nits sweetest flavour when bestowed on those who arenearest and dearest\ntous. As, therefore, in the intimacy existing between friends and\nrelatives the superior shouldput himself on a level with his inferior,\nso the latter oughtnot to grieve that he is surpassed by the former in\nintellect, fortune, orposition. But many of the latter kind are\ncontinuallyuttering somecomplaints or reproaches even, especially if\nthey think that they have done anything which theycan speak of as an\nact of duty and of friendship, involving acertain amount of toil. A\nvery disagreeableclass ofpeople,certainly, are those who are ever\nobtruding their own services, which ought to be kept in mind by him for\nwhom they wereperformed and shouldnot be mentioned by him who\nperformed them. As, therefore, in friendship, those who are superior\nshould lower themselves, so, in a measure, should they liftup their\ninferiors. For there arecertain men who render friendships disagreeable\nby thinking themselves slighted — a thing which rarely happens, except\nin thecase ofpersons who think that they really deserve to be\nslighted; but they ought to be relieved of such an opinionnot by words\nonly but by action. Now, in the firstplace, you must render to each\nfriend as much aid as youcan, and, in the secondplace, as much as he\nwhom you love and assist has thecapacity to bear. For however eminent\nyou may be, youcannot lead all your friends through the various grades\nto the highest official rank, as Scipio was able to do when he made\nPublius Rupilius Rupilius ')\" onmouseout=\"nd();\"> ºconsul, though he\ncouldnot accomplish this result in thecase of his brother, Lucius\nRupilius. º But even if youcould bestowupon another any honour you\nchose, yet you mustconsider what he is able to bear.</p>\n<p>As a rule decisions about friendships should be formed after strength\nand stability have been reached in mind and age;nor should men who in\nboyhood were devoted to hunting and games of ball, keep as their\nintimates those whom they loved at thatperiod simply because they were\nfond of the samepursuits. For on thatprinciplenurses and the slaves\nwho attendedus to and from school, will, by right ofpriority of\nacquaintance,claim the largest share of our goodwill. I admit that they\narenot to beneglected, but they are to be regarded in an entirely\ndifferent way;underno otherconditionscan friendship remain secure.\nFor difference ofcharacter is attended by difference of taste that\nsevers friendships;nor is there any othercause why good mencannot be\nfriends to wicked men, or wicked men to good men, except that there is\nthe greatestpossible distance between them incharacter and in taste.</p>\n<p>This rule also mayproperly beprescribed in friendship: Letnot a sort\nofungoverned goodwill (as very frequently happens) hinder your friends'\nadvantage in important matters. For indeed, if I may go back to legends,\nNeoptolemuscouldnot have taken Troy if he had been willing to listen\nto Lycomedes, by whom he had been reared and who endeavoured with many\ntears to hinder him from setting out. Often, too, important duties arise\nwhich require the temporary separation of friends; and he who would\nhinder the discharge of those duties because hecannot easily bear his\ngrief at the absence of friends, isnot only weak and effeminate, but,\non that very account, is far from reasonable in his friendship. In\nbrief, it is your duty on every occasion toconsidercarefully both what\nyou will demand from a friend and what you willpermit him to obtain\nwhen he makes a demand on you.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, there is a sort of disaster inconnexion with breaking off\nfriendships — fornow our discussion descends from the intimacies of the\nwise to friendships of the ordinary kind— which is sometimes\nunavoidable. There are often in friends outbreaks of vice which affect\nsometimes their actual friends, sometimes strangers, yet so that the\ninfamy of the evil flows over on to the friends. Therefore the ties of\nsuch friendships should be sundered by a gradual relaxation of intimacy,\nand, as I have heard that Catoused to say, \"They should beunravelled\nrather than rent apart,\"unless there has been some outbreak ofutterly\nunbearable wrongdoing, so that the onlycourseconsistent with rectitude\nand honour, and indeed the only onepossible, is to effect an immediate\nwithdrawal of affection and association.</p>\n<p>But if, on the other hand, asusually happens, a merechange of\ndisposition and of tastes should occur, or if a difference inpolitical\nviews should arise (for I am talkingnow, as I said a moment ago,not of\nfriendships existing between wise men, but of those of the ordinary\nkind),care must be taken lest it appear,not only that friendship has\nbeenput aside, but that open hostility has been aroused. Fornothing is\nmore discreditable than to be at war with one with whom you have lived\non intimate terms. Scipio, as you both know, had severed his friendship\nwith Quintus Pompeius on my account;and, moreover, because of a\ndisagreement inpolitics, was estranged from mycolleague, Metellus; he\nacted with deliberation and moderation in each instance, and without any\nbitter feeling of resentment. Wherefore, in the firstplace,pains must\nbe taken that, ifpossible,no discord should arise between friends, but\nincase it does, then ourcare should be that the friendships appear to\nhave burned out rather than to have been stamped out. And you must\nindeed be on your guard lest friendships bechanged into serious\nenmities, which are the source of disputes, abuse, and invective. Yet\neven these, if endurable, are to be borne, and such respect is to be\npaid to the old-time friendship that he may be in the wrong who\ncommitted the offence andnot he who suffered it.</p>\n<p>In short: there is but one security and oneprovision against these ills\nand annoyances, and that is,neither to enlist your love too quicklynor\nto fix it onunworthy men. Now they are worthy of friendship who have\nwithin their own souls the reason for their being loved. A rareclass\nindeed! And really everything splendid is rare, andnothing is harder to\nfind than something which in all respects is aperfect specimen of its\nkind. But the majority of men recognizenothing whatever in human\nexperience as goodunless it brings someprofit and they regard their\nfriends as they do theircattle, valuing most highly those which give\nhope of the largest gain. Thus do they fail to attain that loveliest,\nmost spontaneous friendship, which is desirable in and for itself; and\nthey donot learn from their own experience what thepower of such\nfriendship is and are ignorant of itsnature and extent. For everyone\nloves himself,not with a view of acquiring someprofit himself from his\nself-love, but because he is dear to himself on his own account; and\nunless this same feeling were transferred to friendship, the real friend\nwouldnever be found; for he is, as it were, another self.</p>\n<p>Now if it is evident in animals, whether of the air, the water, or the\nland, and whether tame or wild, first, that they love themselves — for\nthis feeling is born alike in every livingcreature — and, secondly,\nthat they require and eagerly search for other animals of their own kind\nto which they may attach themselves — and this they do with a longing in\nsome degree resembling human love — then how much more, by the law of\nhisnature, is this thecase with man who both loves himself anduses\nhis reason to seek out another whose soul he may so mingle with his own\nas almost to make one out of two!</p>\n<p>But most menunreasonably,not to say shamelessly, want a friend to be\nsuch as theycannot be themselves and require from friends what they\nthemselves donot bestow. But the fair thing is, first of all, to be a\ngood man yourself and then to seek another like yourself. It is among\nsuch men that this stability of friendship, of which I have been\ntreating for some time, may be made secure; and whenunited by ties of\ngoodwill, they will first of all subdue thosepassions to which other\nmen are slaves; and,next, they will delight in what is equitable and\naccords with law, and will go to all lengths for each other; they will\nnot demand from each other anythingunless it is honourable and just,\nand they willnot onlycherish and love, but they will also revere, each\nother. For he who takes reverence from friendship, takes away its\nbrightest jewel. Therefore a fatal mistake is made by those who think\nthat friendship opens wide the door to everypassion and to every sin.\nFriendship was given tous bynature as the handmaid of virtue,not as a\ncomrade of vice; because virtuecannot attain her highest aims\nunattended, but only inunion and fellowship with another. Such a\npartnership as this, whether it is, or was, or is yet to be, should be\nconsidered the best and happiestcomradeship along the road tonature's\nhighest good. In such apartnership, I say, abide all things that men\ndeem worthy ofpursuit — honour and fame and delightful tranquillity of\nmind; so that when these blessings are at hand life is happy, and\nwithout them, itcannot be happy.</p>\n<p>Since happiness is our best and highest aim, we must, if we would attain\nit, give our attention to virtue, without which wecan obtainneither\nfriendshipnor any other desirable thing; on the other hand, those who\nslight virtue and yet think that they have friends,perceive their\nmistake at last when some grievous misfortune forces them toput their\nfriends to the test. Therefore, I repeat the injunction, for it should\nbe said again and again: you should love your friend after you have\nappraised him; you shouldnot appraise him after you have begun to love\nhim. But we arepunished for ournegligence in many things, and\nespecially are we most grievouslypunished for ourcarelessness in the\nchoice and treatment of our friends; for we deliberate after the event,\nand we do what the ancientproverb forbids — we argue thecase after the\nverdict is found. Accordingly, after we have become involved with others\nin a mutual affection, either by long association or by interchange of\nfavours, somecause of offence arises and we suddenly break the bonds of\nfriendship asunder when it has run but half itscourse.</p>\n<p>Thereforecarelessness so great in regard to a relation absolutely\nindispensable deserves the more to becensured. For the one thing in\nhuman experience about whose advantage all men with one voice agree, is\nfriendship; even virtue itself is regarded withcontempt by many and is\nsaid to be merepretence and display; many disdain riches, because they\narecontent with little and take delight in meagre fare andplain dress;\npolitical honours, too, for which some have a burning desire — how many\nso despise them that they believenothing more empty andnothing more\ninane! Likewise other things, which seem to some to be worthy of\nadmiration, are by many thought to be ofno value at all. Butconcerning\nfriendship, all, to a man, think the same thing: those who have devoted\nthemselves topublic life; those who find their joy in science and\nphilosophy; those who manage their own business free frompubliccares;\nand, finally, those who are wholly givenup to sensualpleasures — all\nbelieve that without friendship life isno life at all, or at least they\nso believe if they have any desire whatever to live the life of free\nmen. For itcreeps imperceptibly, I knownot how, into every life, and\nsuffersno mode of existence to be devoid of itspresence.</p>\n<p>Nay, even if anyone were of anature so savage and fierce as to shun and\nloathe the society of men — such, for example, as tradition tellsus a\ncertain Timon of Athens once was — yet even such a mancouldnot refrain\nfrom seeking someperson before whom he mightpour out the venom of his\nembittered soul. Moreover, the view just expressed might best be\nappraised if such a thing as thiscould happen: suppose that a god\nshould removeus from these haunts of men andputus in some solitary\nplace, and, whileprovidingus there inplenteous abundance with all\nmaterial things for which ournature yearns, should take fromus\naltogether thepower to gazeupon our fellow men — who would be such a\nman of iron as to be able to endure that sort of a life? And who is\nthere from whom solitude wouldnot snatch the enjoyment of every\npleasure?True, therefore, is thatcelebrated saying of Archytas of\nTarentum, I think it was — a saying which I have heard repeated by our\nold men who in their turn heard it from their elders. It is to this\neffect: \"If a man should ascend alone into heaven and beholdclearly the\nstructure of theuniverse and the beauty of the stars, there would beno\npleasure for him in the awe-inspiring sight, which would have filled him\nwith delight if he had had someone to whom hecould describe what he had\nseen.\" Thusnature, lovingnothing solitary, always strives for some\nsort of support, and man's best support is a very dear friend.</p>\n<p>But though this samenature declares by so manyutterances what she\nwishes, what she seeks, and what she ardently longs for, yet we somehow\ngrow deaf and donot hearken to her voice. For varied andcomplex are\nthe experiences of friendship, and they afford manycauses for suspicion\nand offence, which it is wise sometimes to ignore, sometimes to make\nlight of, and sometimes to endure. But there is onecause of offence\nwhich must be encountered in order that both theusefulness and loyalty\nof friendship may bepreserved; for friends frequently must benot only\nadvised, but also rebuked, and both advice and rebuke should be kindly\nreceived when given in a spirit of goodwill. But somehow it is true, as\nput by my intimate friend in his Andria:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Complaisance getsus friends,plain speaking, hate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A troublesome thing is truth, if it is indeed the source of hate, which\npoisons friendship; but much more troublesome iscomplaisance, which, by\nshowing indulgence to the sins of a friend, allows him to becarried\nheadlong away; but the greatest fault is in him who both scornfully\nrejects truth and is driven bycomplaisance to ruin.</p>\n<p>Therefore, in this entire matter reason andcare must beused, first,\nthat advice be free from harshness, and second, that reproof be free\nfrom insult. But in showingcomplaisance — I am glad to adopt Terence's\nword, obsequium — letcourtesy be at hand, and let flattery, the\nhandmaid of vice, be far removed, as it isunworthynot only of a friend\nbut even of a free man; for we live in one way with a tyrant and in\nanother with a friend. Now we must despair of the safety of the man\nwhose ears are soclosed to truth that hecannot hear what is true from\na friend. For there is shrewdness in that well-known saying of Cato, as\nthere was in much that he said: \"Some men are better served by their\nbitter-tongued enemies than by their sweet-smiling friends; because the\nformer often tell the truth, the latter,never.\" And furthermore, it is\nabsurd that men who are admonished donot feel vexation at what ought to\nvex them, but do feel it at what oughtnot; for they are annoyed,not at\nthe sin, but at the reproof; whereas, on thecontrary, they ought to\ngrieve for the offence and rejoice at itscorrection.</p>\n<p>As, therefore, it ischaracteristic of true friendship both to give and\nto receive advice and, on the one hand, to give it with all freedom of\nspeech, but without harshness, and on the other hand, to receive it\npatiently, but without resentment, sonothing is to beconsidered a\ngreater bane of friendship than fawning,cajolery, or flattery; for give\nit as manynames as youchoose, it deserves to be branded as a vice\npeculiar to fickle and false-hearted men who say everything with a view\ntopleasure andnothing with a view to truth. Moreover, hypocrisy isnot\nonly wickedunder allcircumstances, because itpollutes truth and takes\naway thepower to discern it, but it is also especially inimical to\nfriendship, since itutterly destroys sincerity, without which the word\nfriendshipcan haveno meaning. And since the effect of friendship is to\nmake, as it were, one soul out of many, how will that bepossible ifnot\neven in one man taken by himself shall there be a soul always one and\nthe same, but fickle,changeable, and manifold?For whatcan be aspliant\nand erratic as the soul of the man whochangesnot only to suit\nanother's humour and desire, but even his expression and hisnod?</p>\n<p>&#x3C;divclass=\"quote\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He says \"nay,\" and \"nay\" say I; he says \"yea,\" and \"yea\" say I; in fine,\nI bade myself agree with him in everything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was said by Terence whom I quoted before, but he says it in the\ncharacter of Gnatho; and to have such a man for a friend on any terms is\na mark of inconstancy. However, there are many like Gnatho, though his\nsuperiors in birth, fortune, and reputation, who become dangerous\nflatterers when their insincerity is supported by theirposition. But by\nthe exercise ofcare a fawning friend may be separated and distinguished\nfrom a true friend, just as everythingpretended and false may be\ndistinguished from what is genuine and true. Apublic assembly, though\ncomposed of very ignorant men,can,nevertheless,usually see the\ndifference between a demagogue — that is, a smooth-tongued, shallow\ncitizen — and one who has stability, sincerity, and weight. With what\nflattering words Gaius Papiriusnot long ago insinuated himself into the\nfavour of the assembly, when he was trying tocarry a law making the\npeople's tribunes eligible for re‑election! I spoke against it — but I\nwillnot talk of myself, it will give me morepleasure to talk about\nScipio. Ye gods! What weight and majesty there was in his speech on that\noccasion! One would have said, without hesitation, that he was the\nleader of the Romanpeople,not theircomrade. But you both were\npresent; besides, his speech ispublished. As a result this \"people's\nlaw\" was rejected by thepeople's votes.</p>\n<p>Again — andpardon me for referring to myself — you remember when Lucius\nMancinus and Scipio's brother, Quintus Maximus, wereconsuls,howpopular\napparently was theproposed law of Gaius Licinius Crassus regarding the\npriestly offices — for the right toco‑opt to vacanciespossessed by the\ncollege was beingconverted intopatronage for thepeople. (By the way,\nCrassus was the first man to begin thepractice of facing towards the\nforum in addressing thepeople.)Nevertheless, through my speech in\nreply, reverence for the immortal gods easilyprevailed over the\nplausible oration of Crassus. And this tookplace while I waspraetor\nand five years before I was electedconsul. Thus thecause was won more\nby its own merit than by the influence of one holding a very high\nofficial rank.</p>\n<p>Now, if on the stage, I mean on theplatform, where there is the\ngreatest opportunity for deception and disguise, truth yetprevails,\nprovided it is madeplain and brought into the light of day, what ought\nto be thecase with friendship which is wholly weighed in the scales of\ntruth? For in friendship,unless, as the saying is, you behold and show\nan open heart, youcan haveno loyalty orcertainty andnot even the\nsatisfaction of loving and of being loved, since you donot know what\ntrue love is. And yet this flattery of which I spoke, however deadly it\nmay be,can harmno one except him who receives it and delights in it.\nIt follows that the man who lends the readiest ear to flatterers is the\none who is most given to self-flattery and is most satisfied with\nhimself.</p>\n<p>I grant that Virtue loves herself; for she best knows herself and\nrealizes how lovable she is; but it isnot virtue I am talking about but\na reputation for virtue. For many wishnot so much to be, as to seem to\nbe, endowed with real virtue. Such men delight in flattery, and when a\ncomplimentary remark is fashioned to suit their fancy they think the\nemptyphrase isproof of their own merits. There isnothing, therefore,\nin a friendship in which one of theparties to it doesnot wish to hear\nthe truth and the other is ready to lie. Nor should we see any humour in\nthe fawningparasites incomedies if there wereno braggart soldiers. In\ntruth did Thais send me many thanks?</p>\n<p>It would have been enough to answer, \"Many.\" \"Millions of them,\" said\ntheparasite. The flatterer always magnifies that which the one for\nwhose gratification he speaks wishes to be large. Wherefore, although\nthat sort of hollow flattery influences those whocourt and make a bid\nfor it, yet even stronger and steadier men should be warned to be on\ntheir guard lest they be taken in by flattery of thecrafty kind.</p>\n<p>No one, to be sure,unless he is anutter fool, fails to detect the open\nflatterer, but we must exercise a watchfulcare against the deep and\ncrafty one lest he stealuponusunawares. For he is very hard to\nrecognize, since he often fawns even by opposing, and flatters and\ncajoles bypretending to quarrel,until at last he gives in, allowing\nhimself to be overcome so that his dupe may appear to have seen further\ninto the matter than himself. And yet, is there anything more\ndiscreditable than to be made a dupe? Ifnot, then we should be all the\nmore on our guard that it doesnot happen tous to have toconfess:</p>\n<p>To-day, of all old fools thatplay thecomicparts, You've wheedled me\nthe most and made your greatest dupe.</p>\n<p>For even on the stage the silliestcharacters take theparts of old men\nlacking in foresight and easily deceived.</p>\n<p>But in someunaccountable way I have drifted away from the friendship of\nfaultless men — that is, men of wisdom, such wisdom I mean as is\nobserved to fall to the lot of man — and I have rambled on to a\ndiscussion of friendships of the frivolous kind. Wherefore, let me\nreturn to the topic with which I began and finallyput an end even to\nthat.</p>\n<p>Virtue, my dear Gaius Fannius, and you, my dear Quintus Mucius, Virtue,\nI say, bothcreates the bond of friendship andpreserves it. For in\nVirtue iscomplete harmony, in her ispermanence, in her is fidelity;\nand what she has raised her head and shown her own light and has seen\nand recognized the same light in another, she moves towards it and in\nturn receives its beams; as a result love or friendship leaps into\nflame; for both words derived from a word meaning \"to love.\"But love is\nnothing other than the great esteem and affection felt for him who\ninspires that sentiment, and it isnot sought because of materialneed\nor for the sake of material gain. Nevertheless even this blossoms forth\nfrom friendship, although you didnot make it your aim.</p>\n<p>Because of this friendly impulse, I, as a young man, became attached to\nthose old men, Lucius Paulus, Marcus Cato, Gaius Gallus, Publius Nasica,\nand Tiberius Gracchus, father-in‑law of my dear Scipio. And while that\nfeeling is stronger between men of the same age, as between Scipio,\nLucius Furius, Publius Rupilius, Spurius Mummius, and myself; yet, in\nturn,now that I am old, I findpleasure in the affection of young men,\nlike yourselves and Quintus Tubero; and I find delight also in social\nintercourse with still younger men like Publius Rutilius and Aulus\nVerginius. And since it is the law of human life and of humannature\nthat anew generation is evercoming forth, it is really most desirable,\nwhen youcan, to reach the goal, so to speak, with men of your own age —\nthose with whom you began the race of life.</p>\n<p>But inasmuch as things human are frail and fleeting, we must be ever on\nthe search for somepersons whom we shall love and who will loveus in\nreturn; for if goodwill and affection are taken away, every joy is taken\nfrom life. For me, indeed, though he was suddenly snatched away, Scipio\nstill lives and will always live; for it was his virtue thatcaused my\nlove and that isnot dead. Nor is it only in my sight and for me, who\nhad itconstantly within my reach, that his virtue lives; it will even\nshed its light and splendour on menunborn. No one will everundertake\nwithcourage and hope the larger tasks of life without thinking that he\nmustcontinually keep before him the memory and example of that\nillustrious man.</p>\n<p>For mypart, of all the blessings that fortune ornature has bestowed on\nme, there isnone which Icancompare with Scipio's friendship. In it I\nfound agreement onpublic questions; in it,counsel inprivate business,\nand in it, too, a leisure ofunalloyed delight. And, so far as I was\naware, Inever offended him in even the most trivialpoint;nor did I\never hear a word from him that Icould wishunsaid; there was one home\nforus both; we had the same fare and shared it incommon, and we were\ntogethernot only in our militarycampaigns, but also in our foreign\ntours and on our vacations in thecountry.</p>\n<p>Whyneed I speak of ourconstant devotion to investigation and to\nlearning in which, remote from the gaze of men, we spent all our leisure\ntime? If my recollection and memory of these things had died with him, I\ncouldnotnow by any means endure the loss of a man so verynear and\ndear to me. But those experiences with him arenot dead; rather they are\nnourished and made more vivid by my reflection and memory; and even if I\nwereutterly deprived of thepower to recall them, yet my age would of\nitself afford me great relief; for Icannot have much longer time to\nbear this bereavement; besides, every trial, which is of brief duration,\nought to be endurable, even if it be severe.</p>\n<p>This is all that I had to say about friendship; but I exhort you both so\nto esteem virtue (without which friendshipcannot exist), that,\nexcepting virtue, you will thinknothing more excellent than friendship.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Laelius De Amicitia by Cicero"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"pathSlug":"/cicero","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/sharing-useful-content","title":"Sharing Useful Content","tags":["devops","microservices","learning","cloud","education"]}},"next":null}}}
