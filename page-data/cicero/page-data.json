After\nhis death I betook myself to the pontiff, Scaevola, who, both in\nintellect and in integrity, was, I venture to assert, quite the most\ndistinguished man of our State. But of him I shall speak at another\ntime; now I return to the augur.</p>\n<p>Numerous events in the latter's life often recur to me, but the most\nmemorable one of all occurred at his home, as he was sitting, according\nto his custom, on a semi-circular garden bench, when I and only a few of\nhis intimate friends were with him, and he happened to fall upon a topic\nwhich, just about that time, was in many people's mouths. You, Atticus,\nwere much in the society of Publius Sulpicius, and on that account are\nthe more certain to remember what great astonishment, or rather\ncomplaining, there was among the people when Sulpicius, while plebeian\ntribune, separated himself in deadly hatred from the then consul,\nQuintus Pompeius, with whom he had lived on the most intimate and\naffectionate terms. And so, Scaevola, having chanced to mention this\nvery fact, thereupon proceeded to repeat to us a discussion on\nfriendship, which Laelius had had with him and with another son-in‑law,\nGaius Fannius, son of Marcus, a few days after the death of Africanus. I\ncommitted the main points of that discussion to memory, and have set\nthem out in the present book in my own way; for I have, so to speak,\nbrought the actors themselves on the stage in order to avoid too\nfrequent repetition of \"said I\" and \"said he,\" and to create the\nimpression that they are present and speaking in person. For while you\nwere pleading with me again and again to write something on friendship,\nthe subject appealed to me as both worthy of general study, and also\nwell fitted to our intimacy. Therefore I have not been unwilling to\nbenefit the public at your request. But, as in my Cato the Elder, which\nwas written to you on the subject of old age, I represented Cato, when\nan old man, as the principal speaker, because I thought no one more\nsuitable to talk of that period of life than he who had been old a very\nlong time and had been a favourite of fortune in old age beyond other\nmen; so, since we had learned from our forefathers that the intimacy of\nGaius Laelius and Publius Scipio was most noteworthy, I concluded that\nLaelius was a fit person to expound the very views on friendship which\nScaevola remembered that he had maintained. Besides, discourses of this\nkind seem in some way to acquire greater dignity when founded on the\ninfluence of men of ancient times, especially such as are renowned; and,\nhence, in reading my own work on Old Age I am at times so affected that\nI imagine Cato is the speaker and not myself. But as in that book I\nwrote as one old man to another old man on the subject of old age, so\nnow in this book I have written as a most affectionate friend to a\nfriend on the subject of friendship. In the former work the speaker was\nCato, whom scarcely any in his day exceeded in age and none surpassed in\nwisdom; in the present treatise the speaker on friendship will be\nLaelius, a wise man (for he was so esteemed), and a man who was\ndistinguished by a glorious friendship. Please put me out of your mind\nfor a little while and believe that Laelius himself is talking. Gaius\nFannius and Quintus Mucius Scaevola have come to their father-in‑law's\nhouse just after the death of Africanus;the conversation is begun by\nthem and reply is made by Laelius, whose entire discourse is on\nfriendship, and as you read it you will recognize in it a portrait of\nyourself.</p>\n<p>Fannius. What you say is true, Laelius; for there was no better man than\nAfricanus, and no one more illustrious. But you should realize that all\nmen have fixed their eyes on you alone; you it is whom they both call\nand believe to be wise. Recently this title was given to Marcus Cato and\nwe know that Lucius Acilius was called \"the Wise\" in our fathers' time,\nbut each of them in a somewhat different way: Acilius because of his\nreputation for skill in civil law; Cato because of his manifold\nexperience, and because of the many well-known instances wherein both in\nSenate and forum he displayed shrewdness of foresight, resolution of\nconduct, or sagacity in reply; and as a result, by the time he had\nreached old age, he bore the title of \"the Wise\" as a sort of cognomen.\nBut as to yourself, men are wont to call you wise in a somewhat\ndifferent way, not only because of your mental endowments and natural\ncharacter, but also because of your devotion to study and because of\nyour culture, and they employ the term in your case, not as the ignorant\ndo, but as learned men employ it. And in this sense we have understood\nthat no one in all Greece was \"wise\" except one in Athens, and he, I\nadmit, was actually adjudged \"most wise\" by the oracle of Apollo - for\nthe more captious critics refuse to admit those who are called \"The\nSeven\" into the category of the wise. Your wisdom, in public estimation,\nconsists in this: you consider all your possessions to be within\nyourself and believe human fortune of less account than virtue. Hence\nthe question is put to me and to Scaevola here, too, I believe, as to\nhow you bear the death of Africanus, and the inquiry is the more\ninsistent because, on the last Nones, when we had met as usual for the\npracticeof our augural act in the country home of Decimus Brutus, you\nwere not present, though it had been your custom always to observe that\nday and to discharge its duties with the most scrupulous care.</p>\n<p>Scaevola. There is indeed a great deal of questioning, Gaius Laelius,\njust as Fannius has said, but I state in reply what I have observed:\nthat you bear with composure the pain occasioned by the death of one who\nwas at once a most eminent man and your very dear friend; that you could\nnot be unmoved thereby and that to be so was not consistent with your\nrefined and tender nature and your culture; but as to your not attending\nour college on the Nones, that, I answer, was due to ill-health and not\nto grief.</p>\n<p>Laelius. Your reply was excellent, Scaevola, and it was correct; for no\npersonal inconvenience of any kind ought to have kept me from the\ndischarge of the duty you mentioned, and which I have always performed\nwhen I was well, nor do I think it possible for any event of this nature\nto cause a man of strong nature to neglect any duty. Now as for your\nsaying, Fannius, that so great merit is ascribed to me - merit such as I\nneither admit nor claim - you are very kind; but it seems to me that\nyour estimate of Cato is scarcely high enough. For either no man was\nwise - which really I think is the better view - or, if anyone, it was\nhe. Putting aside all other proof, consider how he bore the death of his\nson! I remembered the case of Paulus, and I had been a constant witness\nof the fortitude of Gallus, but their sons died in boyhood, while Cato's\nson died in the prime of life when his reputation was assured.\nTherefore, take care not to give the precedence over Cato even to that\nman, whom, as you say, Apollo adjudged the wisest of men; the former is\npraised his deeds, the latter for his words.</p>\n<p>Now, as to myself, let me address you both at once and beg you to\nbelieve that the case stands thus:If I were to assert that I am unmoved\nby grief at Scipio's death, it would be for \"wise\" men to judge how far\nI am right, yet, beyond a doubt, my assertion would be false. For I am\nindeed moved by the loss of a friend such, I believe, as I shall never\nhave again, and - as I can assert on positive knowledge - a friend such\nas no other man ever was to me. But I am not devoid of a remedy, and I\nfind very great consolation in the comforting fact that I am free from\nthe delusion which causes most men anguish when their friends depart. I\nbelieve that no ill has befallen Scipio; it has befallen me, if it has\nbefallen anyone; but great anguish for one's own inconveniences is the\nmark of the man who loves not his friend but himself.</p>\n<p>But who would say that all has not gone wonderfully well with him ? For\nunless he had wished to live for ever - a wish he was very far from\nentertaining - what was there, proper for a human being to wish for,\nthat he did not attain? The exalted expectation which his country\nconceived of him in his childhood, he at a bound, through incredible\nmerit, more than realized in his youth. Though he never sought the\nconsulship, he was elected consul twice - the first timebefore he was of\nlegal age, the second time at a period seasonable for him, but almost\ntoo late for the safety of the commonwealth. And he overthrew the two\ncities that were the deadliest foes of our empire and thereby put an end\nnot only to existing wars, but to future wars as well. Why need I speak\nof his most affable manners, of his devotion to his mother, of his\ngenerosity to his sisters, of his kindness to his relatives, of his\nstrict integrity to all men? These things are well known to you both.\nMoreover, how dear he was to the State was indicated by the grief\ndisplayed at his funeral. How, then, could he have gained any advantage\nby the addition of a few more years of life? For even though old age may\nnot be a burden - as I remember Cato, the year before he died,\nmaintained in a discourse with Scipio and myself - yet it does take away\nthat freshness which Scipio kept even to the end.</p>\n<p>Therefore, his life really was such that nothing could be added to it\neither by good fortune or by fame; and, besides, the suddenness of his\ndeath took away the consciousness of dying. It is hard to speak of the\nnature of his death; you both know what people suspect;yet I may say\nwith truth that, of the very many joyous days which he saw in the course\nof his life - days thronged to the utmost with admiring crowds - the\nmost brilliant was the day before he departed this life, when, after the\nadjournment of the Senate, he was escorted home toward evening by the\nConscript Fathers, the Roman populace, and the Latin allies, so that\nfrom so lofty a station of human grandeur he seems to have passed to the\ngods on high rather than to the shades below.</p>\n<p>For I do not agree with those who have recently begun to argue that soul\nand body perish at the same time, and that all things are destroyed by\ndeath. I give greater weight to the old-time view, whether it be that of\nour forefathers, who paid such reverential rites to the dead, which they\nsurely would not have done if they had believed those rites were a\nmatter of indifference to the dead; or, whether it be the view of\nthosewho lived in this land and by their principles and precepts brought\nculture to Great Greece, which now, I admit, is wholly destroyed, but was\nthen flourishing; or, whether it be the view of him who was adjudged by\nthe oracle of Apollo to be the wisest of men, who, though he would argue\non most subjects now on one side and now on the other, yet always\nconsistently maintained that human souls were of God; that upon their\ndeparture from the body a return to heaven lay open to them, and that in\nproportion as each soul was virtuous and just would the return be easy\nand direct.</p>\n<p>Scipio held this same view, for only a few days before his death, in the\npresence of Philus, Manilius and several others (you were there, too,\nScaevola, having gone with me), he, as if with a premonition of his\nfate, discoursed for three days on the commonwealth, and devoted almost\nall of the conclusion of the discussion to the immortality of the soul,\nmaking use of arguments which he had heard, he said, from Africanus the\nElder through a vision in his sleep. If the truth really is that the\nsouls of all good men after death make the easiest escape from what may\nbe termed the imprisonment and fetters of the flesh, whom can we think\nof as having had an easier journey to the gods than Scipio? Therefore, I\nfear that grief at such a fate as his would be a sign more of envy than\nof friendship. But if, on the other hand, the truth rather is that soul\nand body perish at the same time, and that no sensation remains, then,\nit follows that, as there is nothing good in death, so, of a certainty,\nthere is nothing evil. For if a man has lost sensation the result is the\nsame as if he had never been born; and yet the fact that Scipio was born\nis a joy to us and will cause this State to exult so long as it shall\nexist.</p>\n<p>Wherefore, as I have already said, it has gone very well with him, less\nso with me, for, as I was before him in entering life, it had been more\nreasonable to expect that I should have been before him in leaving it.\nStill, such is my enjoyment in the recollection of our friendship that I\nfeel as if my life has been happy because it was spent with Scipio, with\nwhom I shared my public and private cares; lived under the same roof at\nhome; served in the same campaigns abroad, and enjoyed that wherein lies\nthe whole essence of friendship - the most complete agreement in policy,\nin pursuits, and in opinions. Hence, I am not so much delighted by my\nreputation for wisdom which Fannius just now called to mind, especially\nsince it is undeserved, as I am by the hope that the memory of our\nfriendship will always endure; and this thought is the more pleasing to\nme because in the whole range of history only three or four pairsof\nfriends are mentioned; and I venture to hope that among such instances\nthe friendship of Scipio and Laelius will be known to posterity.</p>\n<p>Fannius. That cannot be otherwise, Laelius. But since you have mentioned\nfriendship and we are free from public business, it would be very\nagreeable to us - and to Scaevola, too, I hope - if, following your\nusual practice on other subjects when questions concerning them are put\nto you, you would discuss friendship and give us your opinion as to its\ntheory and practice.</p>\n<p>Scaevola. Indeed it will be agreeable to me, and, in fact, I was about\nto make the same request when Fannius forestalled me. Hence your\ncompliance will be very agreeable to us both.</p>\n<p>Laelius. I certainly should raise no objection if I felt confidence in\nmyself, for the subject is a noble one, and we are, as Fannius said,\nfree from public business. But who am I? or what skillhave I? What you\nsuggest is a task for philosophers and, what is more, for Greeks - that\nof discoursing on any subject however suddenly it may be proposed to\nthem. This is a difficult thing to do and requires no little practice.\nTherefore, for a discussion of everything possible to be said on the\nsubject of friendship, I advise you to apply to those who profess that\nart; all that I can do is to urge you to put friendship before all\nthings human; for nothing is so conformable to nature and nothing so\nadaptable to our fortunes whether they be favourable or adverse.</p>\n<p>This, however, I do feel first of all - that friendship cannot exist\nexcept among good men; nor do I go into that too deeply, as is done by\nthosewho, in discussing this point with more than usual accuracy, and it\nmay be correctly, but with too little view to practical results, say\nthat no one is good unless he is wise. We may grant that; but they\nunderstand wisdom to be a thing such as no mortal man has yet attained.\nI, however, am bound to look at things as they are in the experience of\neveryday life and not as they are in fancy or in hope. Never could I say\nthat Gaius Fabricius, Manius Curius, and Tiberius Coruncanius, whom our\nancestors adjudged to be wise, were wise by such a standard as that.\nTherefore, let the Sophists keep their unpopularand unintelligible word\nto themselves, granting only that the men just named were good men. They\nwill not do it though; they will say that goodness can be predicated\nonly of the \"wise\" man. Let us then proceed \"with our own dull wits,\" as\nthe saying is. Those who so act and so live as to give proof of loyalty\nand uprightness, of fairness and generosity; who are free from all\npassion, caprice, and insolence, and have great strength of character -\nmen like those just mentioned - such men let us consider good, as they\nwere accounted good in life, and also entitled to be called by that term\nbecause, in as far as that is possible for man, they follow Nature, who\nis the best guide to good living.</p>\n<p>For it seems clear to me that we were so created that between us all\nthere exists a certain tie which strengthens with our proximity to each\nother. Therefore, fellow countrymen are preferred to foreigners and\nrelativesa to strangers, for with them Nature herself engenders\nfriendship, but it is one that is lacking in constancy. For friendship\nexcels relationshipb in this, that goodwill may be eliminated from\nrelationship while from friendship it cannot; since, if you remove\ngoodwill from friendship the very name of friendship is gone; if you\nremove it from relationship, the name of relationship still remains.\nMoreover, how great the power of friendship is may most clearly be\nrecognized from the fact that, in comparison with the infinite ties\nuniting the human race and fashioned by Nature herself, this thing\ncalled friendship has been so narrowed that the bonds of affection\nalways united two persons only, or, at most, a few.</p>\n<p>For friendship is nothing else than an accord in all things, human and\ndivine, conjoined with mutual goodwill and affection, and I am inclined\nto think that, with the exception of wisdom, no better thing has been\ngiven to man by the immortal gods. Some prefer riches, some good health,\nsome power, some public honours, and many even prefer sensual pleasures.\nThis last is the highest aim of brutes; the others are fleeting and\nunstable things and dependent less upon human foresight than upon the\nfickleness of fortune. Again, there are those who place the \"chief good\"\nin virtue and that is really a noble view; but this very virtue is the\nparent and preserver of friendship and without virtue friendship cannot\nexist at all. To proceed then, let us interpret the word \"virtue\" by the\nfamiliar usage of our everyday life and speech, and not in pompous\nphrase apply to it the precise standards which certain philosophers use;\nand let us include in the number of good men those who are so considered - men like Paulus, Cato, Gallus, Scipio, and Philus - who satisfy the\nordinary standard of life; but let us pass by such men as are nowhere to\nbe found at all.</p>\n<p>Therefore, among men like those just mentioned, friendship offers\nadvantagesalmost beyond any power to describe. In the first place, how\ncan life be what Ennius calls \"the life worth living,\" if it does not\nrepose on the mutual goodwill of a friend? What is sweeter than to have\nsomeone with whom you may dare discuss anything as if you were communing\nwith yourself? How could your enjoyment in times of prosperity be so\ngreat if you did not have someone whose joy in them would be equal to\nyour own? Adversity would indeed be hard to bear, without him to whom\nthe burden would be heavier even than to yourself. In short, all other\nobjects of desire are each, for the most part, adapted to a single end -\nriches, for spending; influence, for honour; public office, for\nreputation; pleasures, for sensual enjoyment; and health, for freedom\nfrom pain and full use of the bodily functions; but friendship embraces\ninnumerable ends; turn where you will it is ever at your side; no\nbarrier shuts it out; it is never untimely and never in the way.\nTherefore, we do not use the proverbial\"fire and water\" on more\noccasions than we use friendship. I am not now speaking of the ordinary\nand commonplace friendship - delightful and profitable as it is - but of\nthat pure and faultless kind, such as was that of the few whose\nfriendships are known to fame. For friendship adds a brighter radiance\nto prosperity and lessens the burden of adversity by dividing and\nsharing it.</p>\n<p>Seeing that friendship includes very many and very great advantages, it\nundoubtedly excels all other things in this respect, that it projects\nthe bright ray of hope into the future, and does not suffer the spirit\nto grow faint or to fall. Again, he who looks upon a true friend, looks,\nas it were, upon a sort of image of himself. Wherefore friends, though\nabsent, are at hand; though in need, yet abound; though weak, are\nstrong; and - harder saying still - though dead, are yet alive; so great\nis the esteem on the part of their friends, the tender recollection and\nthe deep longing that still attends them. These things make the death of\nthe departed seem fortunate and the life of the survivors worthy of\npraise. But if you should take the bond of goodwill out of the universe\nno house or city could stand, nor would even the tillage of the fields\nabide. If that statement is not clear, then you may understand how great\nis the power of friendship and of concord from a consideration of the\nresults of enmity and disagreement. For what house is so strong, or what\nstate so enduring that it cannot be utterly overthrown by animosities\nand division? From this it may be judged how great good there is in\nfriendship. It is said, at any rate, that a certain learned man of\nAgrigentumsang in inspired strain in Greek verse that in nature and the\nentire universe whatever things are at rest and whatever are in motion\nare united by friendship and scattered by discord. And indeed this is a\nstatement which all men not only understand but also approve. Whenever,\ntherefore, there comes to light some signal service in undergoing or\nsharing the dangers of a friend, who does not proclaim it with the\nloudest praise? What shouts recently rang through the entire theatre\nduring the performance of the new play, written by my guest and friend,\nMarcus Pacuvius, at the scene where, the king being ignorant which of the\ntwo was Orestes, Pylades, who wished to be put to death instead of his\nfriend, declared, \"I am Orestes,\" while Orestes continued steadfastly to\nassert, as was the fact, \"I am Orestes!\" The people in the audience rose\nto their feet and cheered this incident in fiction; what, think we,\nwould they have done had it occurred in real life? In this case Nature\neasily asserted her own power, inasmuch as men approved in another as\nwell done that which they could not do themselves.</p>\n<p>Within the foregoing limits I have, I think, been able to state my\nestimate of friendship; if there is anything more to be said - and I\nbelieve there is a great deal - inquire, if you please, of those who\nmake a business of such discussions.</p>\n<p>Fannius. But we prefer to inquire of you. I have, it is true, often\nquestioned those men too, and indeed have not been an unwilling\nlistener, but the thread of your discourse is of a somewhat different\ntexture.</p>\n<p>Scaevola. You would say so with greater confidence, Fannius, if you had\nbeen present recently in Scipio's country home during the discussion on\nthe Republic. What an advocate of justice Laelius was then against the\nelaborate speech of Philus! Fannius. Ah ! but it was an easy thing for\nthe most just of men to defend justice. Scaevola. Well, then, would not\nthe defence of friendship be easy for that man who has preserved it with\nthe utmost fidelity, constancy, and sense of justice, and thereby gained\nthe greatest renown?</p>\n<p>Laelius. Really you are employing violence; for what matters it what\nmeans you take of forcing me? Forcing me you certainly are. For it is\nnot only hard, but not even right, to withstand the earnest requests of\none's sons-in‑law, particularly in a good cause.</p>\n<p>The oftener, therefore, I reflect on friendship the more it seems to me\nthat consideration should be given to the question, whether the longing\nfor friendship is felt on account of weakness and want, so that by the\ngiving and receiving of favours one may get from another and in turn\nrepay what he is unable to procure of himself; or, although this mutual\ninterchange is really inseparable from friendship, whether there is not\nanother cause, older, more beautiful, and emanating more directly from\nNature herself. For it is love ( amor ), from which the word\n\"friendship\" ( amicitia ) is derived, that leads to the establishing of\ngoodwill. For while it is true that advantages are frequently obtained\neven from those who, under a pretence of friendship, are courted and\nhonoured to suit the occasion; yet in friendship there is nothing false,\nnothing pretended; whatever there is is genuine and comes of its own\naccord. Wherefore it seems to me that friendship springs rather from\nnature than from need, and from an inclination of the soul joined with a\nfeeling of love rather than from calculation of how much profit the\nfriendship is likely to afford. What this feeling is may be perceived\neven in the case of certain animals, which, up to a certain time, so\nlove their offspring and are so loved by them, that their impulses are\neasily seen. But this is much more evident in man; first, from the\naffection existing between children and parents, which cannot be\ndestroyed except by some execrable crime, and again from that kindred\nimpulse of love, which arises when once we have met someone whose habits\nand character are congenial with our own; because in him we seem to\nbehold, as it were, a sort of lamp of uprightness and virtue. For there\nis nothing more lovable than virtue, nothing that more allures us to\naffection, since on account of their virtue and uprightness we feel a\nsort of affection even for those whom we have never seen. Is there\nanyone who does not dwell with some kindly affection on the memory of\nGaius Fabricius and Manius Curius, though he never saw them? On the\nother hand, is there anyone who does not hate Tarquin the Proud, Spurius\nCassius, or Spurius Maelius? Against two leaders we had bitter struggles\nfor the empire of Italy - Pyrrhus and Hannibal; for the former, because\nof his uprightness, we have no great enmity; for the latter, because of\nhis cruelty, this State will always entertain hatred.</p>\n<p>Now if the force of integrity is so great that we love it, whether in\nthose we have never seen, or, more wonderful still, even in an enemy,\nwhat wonder that men's souls are stirred when they think they see\nclearly the virtue and goodness of those with whom a close intimacy is\npossible? And yet love is further strengthened by the receiving of a\nkindly service, by the evidence of another's care for us, and by closer\nfamiliarity, and from all these, when joined to the soul's first impulse\nto love, there springs up, if I may say so, a marvellous glow and\ngreatness of goodwill. If people think that friendship springs from\nweakness and from a purpose to secure someone through whom we may obtain\nthat which we lack, they assign her, if I may so express it, a lowly\npedigree indeed, and an origin far from noble, and they would make her\nthe daughter of poverty and want. If this were so, then just in\nproportion as any man judged his resources to be small, would he be\nfitted for friendship; whereas the truth is far otherwise. For to the\nextent that a man relies upon himself and is so fortified by virtue and\nwisdom that he is dependent on no one and considers all his possessions\nto be within himself, in that degree is he most conspicuous for seeking\nout and cherishing friendships. Now what need did Africanus have of\nme?By Hercules! none at all. And I, assuredly, had no need of him\neither, but I loved him because of a certain admiration for his virtue,\nand he, in turn, loved me, because, it may be, of the fairly good\nopinion which he had of my character; and close association added to our\nmutual affection. Although many and great advantages did ensue from our\nfriendship, still the beginnings of our love did not spring from the\nhope of gain. For as men of our class generous and liberal, not for the\npurpose of demanding repayment - for we do not put our favours out at\ninterest, but are by nature given to acts of kindness - so we believe\nthat friendship is desirable, not because we are influenced by hope of\ngain, but because its entire profit is in the love itself.</p>\n<p>From this view those men who, after the manner of cattle, judge\neverything by the standard of pleasure, vigorously dissent; nor is it\nstrange; for the raising of the vision to anything lofty, noble and\ndivine is impossible to men who have abased their every thought to a\nthing so lowly and mean. Therefore let us dismiss these persons from our\nconversation and let us for ourselves believe that the sentiments of\nlove and of kindly affection spring from nature, when intimation has\nbeen given of moral worth; for when men have conceived a longing for\nthis virtue they bend towards it and move closer to it, so that, by\nfamiliar association with him whom they have begun to love, they may\nenjoy his character, equal him in affection, become readier to deserve\nthan to demand his favours, and vie with him in a rivalry of virtue.\nThus the greatest advantages will be realized from friendship, and its\norigin, being derived from nature rather than from weakness, will be\nmore dignified and more consonant with truth. For on the assumption that\nadvantage is the cement of friendships, if advantage were removed\nfriendships would fall apart; but since nature is unchangeable,\ntherefore real friendships are eternal. You now have my views on the\norigin of friendship, unless you have something to say in reply.\nFannius. Pray go on, Laelius, and I answer for my friend here, as I have\nthe right to do, since he is my junior. Scaevola. Well said, Fannius.\nTherefore, let us hear.</p>\n<p>Laelius. Then listen, most worthy gentlemen, to the points very\nfrequently mentioned between Scipio and me in our discussions of\nfriendship. Now he, indeed, used to say that nothing was harder than for\na friendship to continue to the very end of life; for it often happened\neither that the friendship ceased to be mutually advantageous, or the\nparties to it did not entertain the same political views; and that\nfrequently, too, the dispositions of men were changed, sometimes by\nadversity and sometimes by the increasing burdens of age. And then he\nwould draw an illustration of this principle from the analogy of early\nlife. \"For,\" said he, \"the most ardent attachments of boyhood are often\nlaid aside with the boyish dress;but if continued to the time of\nmanhood, they are broken off, sometimes by rivalry in courtship or\nsometimes by a contest for some advantage, in which both of the parties\nto the friendship cannot be successful at the same time. But should the\nfriendship continue for a longer time, yet it is often overthrown when a\nstruggle for office happens to arise; for while, with the generality of\nmen, the greatest bane of friendship is the lust for money, with the\nmost worthy men it is the strife for preferment and glory, and from this\nsource frequently have sprung the deadliest enmities between the dearest\nfriends.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then, too, disagreements of a very serious nature, and usually\njustifiable, arise from a demand upon friends to do something that is\nwrong, as, for example, to become agents of vice or abettors in\nviolence, and when the demand is refused, however honourable the\nrefusal, it is nevertheless charged by those to whom the compliance was\ndenied that the laws of friendship have been disregarded; besides, those\nwho dare demand anything and everything of a friend, by that very demand\nprofess a willingness to do anything whatever for the sake of a friend.\nBy their ceaseless recriminations not only are social intimacies usually\ndestroyed, but also everlasting enmities are produced. So many dangers\nof this kind,\" he would say, \"hover like evil fates over friendships,\nthat it seems to me to require both wisdom and good luck to escape them\nall.\"</p>\n<p>Wherefore, let us first consider, if you please, how far love ought to\ngo in friendship. Supposing Coriolanus to have had friends, were those\nfriends in duty bound to bear arms with him against their country? Or\nought the friends of Vecellinus, or of Maelius, to have supported them\nin their attempts to gain regal power?As to Tiberius Gracchus, when he\nbegan to stir up revolution against the republic, we saw him utterly\ndeserted by Quintus Tubero and by the friends of his own age. And yet\nGaius Blossius of Cumae, a protégé of your family, Scaevola, came to me\nto plead for leniency, because I was present as adviser to the consuls,\nLaenas and Rupilius, and offered, as a reason for my pardoning him, the\nfact that his esteem for Tiberius Gracchus was so great he thought it\nwas his duty to do anything that Tiberius requested him to do. Thereupon\nI inquired, \"Even if he requested you to set fire to the Capitol?\" \"He\nnever would have requested me to do that, of course,\" said he, \"but if\nhe had I should have obeyed.\" You see what an impious remark that was!\nAnd, by heavens! he did all that he said he would do, or rather even\nmore; for he did not follow, but he directed, the infatuation of\nTiberius Gracchus, and he did not offer himself as the comrade in the\nlatter's fury, but as the leader. And so, as a result of his madness,\nbeing in fear of the special court of inquiry, he fled into Asia, joined\nour enemies, and paid a heavy and righteous penaltyfor his crimes\nagainst the Republic.</p>\n<p>Therefore it is no justification whatever of your sin to have sinned in\nbehalf of a friend; for, since his belief in your virtue induced the\nfriendship, it is hard for that friendship to remain if you have\nforsaken virtue. But if we should resolve that it is right, either to\ngrant our friends whatever they wish, or to get from them whatever we\nwish, then, assuming that we were endowed with truly faultless wisdom,\nno harm would result; but I am speaking of the friends before our eyes,\nof those whom we see, or of men of whom we have record, and who are\nknown to everyday life. It is from men of this class our examples should\nbe drawn, but chiefly, I grant you, from those who make the nearest\napproach to wisdom. We read that Aemilius Papus was an intimate friend\nof Gaius Luscinus (so we have received it from our forefathers), that\nthey served together twice as consuls and were colleagues in the\nkinship. Again the tradition is that Manius Curius and Tiberius\nCoruncanius were most closely associated with them and with each other.\nWell, then, it is impossible for us even to suspect any one of these men\nof importuning a friend for anything contrary to good faith or to his\nsolemn oath, or inimical to the commonwealth. What is the need of\nasserting in the case of men like these, that if such a request had been\nmade it would not have been granted, seeing that they were the purest of\nmen, and moreover, regarded it equally impious to grant and make such a\nrequest? But Tiberius Gracchus did find followers in Gaius Carbo and\nGaius Cato, and he found a follower also in his own brother Gaius, who\nthough not very ardent then is now intensely so. Therefore let this law\nbe established in friendship: neither ask dishonourable things, nor do\nthem, if asked. And dishonourable it certainly is, and not to be\nallowed, for anyone to plead in defence of sins in general and\nespecially of those against the State, that he committed them for the\nsake of a friend. For, my dear Fannius and Scaevola, we Romans are now\nplaced in such a situation that it is our duty to keep a sharp look-out\nfor the troubles that may befall our State. Our political practice has\nalready swerved far from the track and course marked out for us by our\nancestors. Tiberius Gracchus tried to obtain regal power - or rather, he\nactually did reign for a few months. Had the Roman people ever heard of\nor experienced such a thing before? What his friends and relatives, who\nfollowed him even after his death, did in the case of Publius ScipioI\ncannot describe without tears. As for Carbo, because of the short time\nsince the punishment of Tiberius Gracchus, we have borne with him as best\nwe could. Now what is to be expected when Gaius Gracchusbecomes tribune,\nI am not inclined to prophesy; º however, revolution creeps on\nimperceptibly at first but once it has acquired momentum, rushes\nheadlong to ruin. You see how much mischief has been caused already in\nthe matter of the ballot, first by the Gabinian law, and two years later\nby the Cassian law. I seem now to see the people estranged from the\nSenate and the weightiest affairs of state determined by the caprice of\nthe mob. For more people will learn how to start a revolution than how\nto withstand it.</p>\n<p>Why do I say these things? Because without associatesno one attempts any\nsuch mischiefs. It must, therefore, be enjoined upon good menthat if by\nany chance they should inadvisedly fall into friendships of this kind,\nthey must not think themselves so bound that they cannot withdraw from\nfriends who are sinning in some important matter of public concern; for\nwicked men, on the other hand, a penalty must be enacted, and assuredly\nit will not be lighter for the followers than for the leaders in\ntreason. Who was more eminent in Greece than Themistocles, who more\npowerful? But he, after having saved Greece from slavery by his\nleadership in the war with Persia, and after having been banished\nbecause of his unpopularity, would not submit to the injustice of an\nungrateful country, as he was in duty bound to do: he did the same thing\nthat Coriolanus had done among our people twenty years before. Not one\nsingle supporter could be found to aid these men against their country;\ntherefore, each took his own life. Hence such alliances of wicked men\nnot only should not be protected by a plea of friendship, but rather\nthey should be visited with summary punishment of the severest kind, so\nthat no one may think it permissible to follow even a friend when waging\nwar against his country. And yet this very thing, considering the course\naffairs have begun to take, will probably happen at some future time; as\nfor me, I am no less concerned for what the condition of the\ncommonwealth will be after my death, than I am for its condition to‑day.</p>\n<p>Therefore let this be ordained as the first law of friendship: Ask of\nfriends only what is honourable; do for friends only what is honourable\nand without even waiting to be asked; let zeal be ever present, but\nhesitation absent; dare to give true advice with all frankness; in\nfriendship let the influence of friends who are wise counsellors be\nparamount, and let that influence be employed in advising, not only with\nfrankness, but, if the occasion demands, even with sternness, and let\nthe advice be followed when given. I say this because certain men who, I\nam informed, are considered sages in Greece, have approved certain\nviews, which, in my opinion, are astonishing (but there is nothing that\nthose men will not pursue with their subtleties). Some of these men\nteach that too much intimacy in friendships should be avoided, lest it\nbe necessary for one man to be full of anxiety for many; that each one\nof us has business of his own, enough and to spare; that it is annoying\nto be too much involved in the affairs of other people; that it is best\nto hold the reins of friendship as loosely as possible, so that we may\neither draw them up or slacken them at will; for, they say, an essential\nof a happy life is freedom from care, and this the soul cannot enjoy if\none man is, as it were, in travail for many.</p>\n<p>Again, there are others, I am told, who, with even less of human\nfeeling, maintain (and I briefly touched on this point just now) that\nfriendships must be sought for the sake of the defence and aid they give\nand not out of goodwill and affection; therefore, that those least\nendowed with firmness of character and strength of body have the\ngreatest longing for friendship; and consequently, that helpless women,\nmore than men, seek its shelter, the poor more than the rich, and the\nunfortunate more than those who are accounted fortunate. O noble\nphilosophy! Why, they seem to take the sun out of the universe when they\ndeprive life of friendship, than which we have from the immortal gods no\nbetter, no more delightful boon. For of what value is their vaunted\n\"freedom from care\"? In appearance it is indeed an alluring thing, but\nin reality often to be shunned. For it is inconsistent not to undertake\nany honourable business or course of conduct, or to lay it aside when\nundertaken, in order to avoid anxiety. Nay, if we continually flee from\ntrouble, we must also flee from Virtue, who necessarily meets with some\ntrouble in rejecting and loathing things contrary to herself, as when\nkindness rejects ill-will, temperance lust, and bravery cowardice. And\nso you may see that it is the just who are most pained at injustice, the\nbrave at cowardice, the self-restrained at profligacy. It is, therefore,\ncharacteristic of the well-ordered mind both to rejoice at good deeds\nand to be pained at the reverse.</p>\n<p>Wherefore, if distress of mind befalls a wise man (as it certainly does\nunless we assume that human sympathy has been rooted out of his heart),\nwhy should we remove friendship entirely from our lives in order that we\nmay suffer no worries on its account? For when the soul is deprived of\nemotion, what difference is there - I do not say between man and the\nbeasts of the field, but between man and a stock or a stone, or any such\nthing? Nor are we to listen to those menwho maintain that virtue is hard\nand unyielding and is, as it were, something made of iron; whereas, in\nmany relations of life, and especially in friendship, it is so pliable\nand elastic that it expands, so to speak, with a friend's prosperity and\ncontracts with his adversity. Wherefore, that mental anguish of which I\nspoke and which often must be felt on a friend's account, has no more\npower to banish friendship from life than it has to cause us to reject\nvirtue because virtue entails certain cares and annoyances.</p>\n<p>But, since, as I said before, virtue knits friendship together, if there\nshould be some exhibition of shining virtue to which a kindred spirit\nmay attach and adjust itself, then, when that happens, love must needs\nspring forth. For is there anything so absurd as to delight in many\ninanimate things, like public office, fame, and stately buildings, or\ndress and personal adornment, and to take little or no delight in a\nsentient being endowed with virtue and capable of loving, and - if I may\nso term it - of loving back?For nothing gives more pleasure than the\nreturn of goodwill and the interchange of zealous service. And what if I\nalso add, as I may fairly do, that nothing so allures and attracts\nanything to itself as likeness does to friendship? Then it surely will\nbe granted as a fact that good men love and join themselves to other\ngood men, in a union which is almost that of relationship and nature.\nFor there is nothing more eager or more greedy than nature for what is\nlike itself. Wherefore, because of this very fact, I think it should be\nevident, Fannius and Scaevola, that the good have for the good, as if\nfrom necessity, a kindly feeling which nature has made the fountain of\nfriendship. But this same goodness belongs also to the generality of\nmen. For virtue is not unfeeling, unwilling to serve, or proudly\nexclusive, but it is her wont to protect even whole nations and to plan\nthe best measures for their welfare, which she certainly would not do if\nshe disdained the affection of the common mass.</p>\n<p>And again, it seems to me at any rate, that those whofalsely assume\nexpediency to be the basis of friendship, take from friendship's chain\nits loveliest link. For it is not so much the material gain procured\nthrough a friend, as it is his love, and his love alone, that gives us\ndelight; and that advantage which we derive from him becomes a pleasure\nonly when his service is inspired by an ardent zeal. And it is far from\nbeing true that friendship is cultivated because of need; rather, is it\ncultivated by those who are most abundantly blessed with wealth and\npower and especially with virtue, which is man's best defence; by those\nleast in need of another's help; and by those most generous and most\ngiven to acts of kindness. Indeed, I should be inclined to think that it\nis not well for friends never to need anything at all. Wherein, for\nexample, would any zeal have displayed itself if Scipio had never been\nin need of my advice or assistance either at home or abroad? It is not\nthe case, therefore, that friendship attends upon advantage, but, on the\ncontrary, that advantage attends upon friendship.</p>\n<p>It will be our duty, then, not to listen to those besotted men of\npleasurewhen they argue about friendship, of which they understand\nneither the practice nor the theory. For what person is there, in the\nname of gods and men! who would wish to be surrounded by unlimited\nwealth and to abound in every material blessing, on condition that he\nlove no one and that no one love him? Such indeed is the life of tyrants - a life, I mean, in which there can be no faith, no affection, no trust\nin the continuance of goodwill; where every act arouses suspicion and\nanxiety and where friendship has no place. For can anyone love either\nthe man whom he fears, or the man by whom he believes himself to be\nfeared? Yet tyrants are courted under a pretence of affection, but only\nfor a season. For when by chance they have fallen from power, as they\ngenerally do, then is it known how poor they were in friends. And this\nis illustrated by the remark said to have been made by Tarquin as he was\ngoing into exile: \"I have learned what friends of mine are true and what\nare false, now that I am no longer able to reward or punish either.\"</p>\n<p>And yet, such was the haughtiness and perversity of the man that I\nwonder if he could have had anyone as a friend. Now just as the\ncharacter of Tarquin could not procure him true friends, so, with many,\ntheir power, if it be very great, is a bar to faithful friendships. For\nnot only is Fortune blind herself, but as a rule she even blinds those\nwhom she has embraced; and thus they are generally transported beyond\nthemselves by wanton pride and obstinacy - nor can anything in the world\nbe more insufferable than one of Fortune's fools. Indeed we may observe\nthat men, formerly affable in their manners, become changed by military\nrank, by power, and by prosperity, spurn their old-time friends and\nrevel in the new. But what is more foolish, when men are in the\nplenitude of resources, opportunities, and wealth, than to procure the\nother things which money provides - horses, slaves, splendid raiment,\nand costly plate - and not procure friends, who are, if I may say so,\nlife's best and fairest furniture? And really while they are procuring\nthose material things, they know not for whom they do it, nor for whose\nbenefit they toil; for such things are the prey of the strongest; but to\nevery man the tenure of his friendships ever remains settled and sure,\nso that even if there should be a continuance of those things which are,\nso to speak, the gratuities of fortune, yet life unadorned and\nunattended by friends could not be pleasant. But enough on this point.</p>\n<p>We now have to determine in our discussion of friendship what are the\nlimits and, so to speak, the boundary lines of affection. On this point\nI observe that three views are usually advanced, none of which I\napprove: first, \"That we should have the same feeling for our friends\nthat we have for ourselves\"; second, \"That our goodwill towards our\nfriends should correspond in all respects to their goodwill toward us,\"\nand third, \"That whatever value a man places upon himself, the same\nvalue should be placed upon him by his friends.\"I do not agree at all\nwith any of these views. Certainly the first one is not true which holds\nthat \"as a man feels towards himself, so should he feel towards his\nfriend.\" For how many things we do for our friends that we never would\ndo for ourselves! At one time we beg and entreat an unworthy man, and\nagain we assail another too sharply or loudly rail upon him - things not\nquite creditable in our own affairs, but exceedingly so in behalf of our\nfriends; and there are numerous occasions when good men forgo, or permit\nthemselves to be deprived of, many conveniences in order that their\nfriends rather than themselves may enjoy them.</p>\n<p>The second view limits friendship to an equal interchange of services\nand feelings. It surely is calling friendship to a very close and petty\naccounting to require it to keep an exact balance of credits and debits.\nI think true friendship is richer and more abundant than that and does\nnot narrowly scan the reckoning lest it pay out more than it has\nreceived; and there need be no fear that some bit of kindness will be\nlost, that it will overflow the measure and spill upon the ground, or\nthat more than is due will be poured into friendship's bin.</p>\n<p>But worst of all is the third limitation, which is that \"whatever value\na man places upon himself, the same value should be placed upon him by\nhis friends.\" For often in some men either the spirit is too dejected,\nor the hope of bettering their fortune is too faint. Therefore, it is\nnot the province of a friend, in such a case, to have the same estimate\nof another that the other has of himself, but rather it is his duty to\nstrive with all his might to arouse his friend's prostrate soul and lead\nit to a livelier hope and into a better train of thought. Hence some\nother limitation of true friendship must be fixed, after I have first\nstated a view which Scipio used to condemn in the strongest terms. He\noften said that no utterance could be found more at war with friendship\nthan that of the man who had made this remark: \"We should love as if at\nsome time we were going to hate.\" And Scipio could not, he said, be\ninduced to adopt the commonly accepted belief that this expression was\nmade by Bias, who was counted one of the Seven Sages; but he thought that\nit was the speech of some abandoned wretch, or scheming politician, or\nof someone who regarded everything as an instrument to serve his own\nselfish ends. For how will it be possible for anyone to be a friend to a\nman who, he believes, may be his foe? Nay, in such a case it will be\nnecessary also for him to desire and pray that his friend may sin as\noften as possible and thereby give him, as it were, the more handles to\nlay hold of; and, again, he will be bound to feel grief, pain and envy\nat the good deeds and good fortune of his friends. Wherefore this maxim,\nwhoever its author, really has the effect of destroying friendship:\nrather ought we to have been enjoined to exercise such care in forming\nfriendships that we should never begin to love anyone whom we might\nsometimes hate. Indeed, Scipio thought that, even if we had been\nunfortunate in our choice, we should endure it rather than plan an\nopportunity for a breach.</p>\n<p>Therefore, these are the limits which I think ought to be observed,\nnamely: when the characters of friends are blameless, then there should\nbe between them complete harmony of opinions and inclinations in\neverything without any exception; and, even if by some chance the wishes\nof a friend are not altogether honourable and require to be forwarded in\nmatters which involve his life or reputation, we should turn aside from\nthe straight path, provided, however, utter disgrace does not follow;for\nthere are limits to the indulgence which can be allowed to friendship.\nNor indeed ought a man either to disregard his reputation, or to\nconsider the goodwill of his countrymen a poor weapon in the battle of\nlife, though to hunt after it with fawning and flattery is disgraceful;\nas to virtue we must by no means abjure it, for it is attended by\nregard.</p>\n<p>But Scipio - and I often recur to him, my sole authority for a discourse\non friendship - Scipio used to complain that men were more painstaking\nin all other things than in friendship; that everybody could tell how\nmany goats and sheep he had, but was unable to tell the number of his\nfriends; and that men took pains in getting the former, but were\ncareless in choosing the latter, and had no certain signs, or marks, so\nto speak, by which to determine their fitness for friendship. We ought,\ntherefore, to choose men who are firm, steadfast and constant, a class\nof which there is a great dearth; and at the same time it is very hard\nto come to a decision without a trial, while such trial can only be made\nin actual friendship: thus friendship outruns the judgement and takes\naway the opportunity of a trial. Hence it is the part of wisdom to check\nthe headlong rush of goodwill as we would that of a chariot, and thereby\nso manage friendship that we may in some degree put the dispositions of\nfriends, as we do those of horses, to a preliminary test. Some men often\ngive proof in a petty money transaction how unstable they are; while\nothers, who could not have been influenced by a trivial sum, are\ndiscovered in one that is large. But if any shall be found who think it\nbase to prefer money to friendship, where shall we find those who do not\nput office, civil and military rank, high place and power, above\nfriendship, so that when the former advantages are placed before them on\none side and the latter on the other they will not much prefer the\nformer? For feeble is the struggle of human nature against power, and\nwhen men have attained it even by the disregard of friendship they\nimagine the sin will be forgotten because friendship was not disregarded\nwithout a weighty cause. Therefore, true friendships are very hard to\nfind among those whose time is spent in office or in business of a\npublic kind. For where can you find a man so high-minded as to prefer\nhis friend's advancement to his own? And, passing by material\nconsiderations, pray consider this: how grievous and how hard to most\npersons does association in another's misfortunes appear! Nor is it easy\nto find men who will go down to calamity's depths for a friend. Ennius,\nhowever, is right when he says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When Fortune's fickle the faithful friend is found;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>yet it is on these two charges that most men are\nconvicted of fickleness: they either hold a friend of little value when\ntheir own affairs are prosperous, or they abandon him when his are\nadverse. Whoever, therefore, in either of these contingencies, has shown\nhimself staunch, immovable, and firm in friendship ought to be\nconsidered to belong to that class of men which is exceedingly rare -\naye, almost divine.</p>\n<p>Now the support and stay of that unswerving constancy, which we look for\nin friendship, is loyalty; for nothing is constant that is disloyal.\nMoreover, the right course is to choose for a friend one who is frank,\nsociable, and sympathetic - that is, one who is likely to be influenced\nby the same motives as yourself - since all these qualities conduce to\nloyalty; for it is impossible for a man to be loyal whose nature is full\nof twists and twinings;and, indeed, one who is untouched by the same\ninfluences as yourself and is naturally unsympathetic cannot be either\nloyal or steadfast. To this observation should be added a requirement\ntending to produce that steadfastness, which I have been discussing for\nsome time: a friend must neither take pleasure in bringing charges\nagainst you nor believe them when made by others. And so, the truth of\nwhat I said in the beginning is established: \"Friendship cannot exist\nexcept among good men.\"</p>\n<p>For it is characteristic of the good man, whom I may also call the wise\nman, to maintain these two rules in friendship: first, let there be no\nfeigning or hypocrisy; for it is more befitting a candid man to hate\nopenly than to mask his real thoughts with a lying face; secondly, let\nhim not only reject charges preferred by another, but also let him avoid\neven being suspicious and ever believing that his friend has done\nsomething wrong. To this should be added a certain affability of speech\nand manner, which gives no mean flavour to friendship. While unvarying\nseriousness and gravity are indeed impressive, yet friendship ought to\nbe more unrestrained, genial, and agreeable, and more inclined to be\nwholly courteous and urbane.</p>\n<p>But at this point there arises a certain question of some little\ndifficulty: Are new friends who are worthy of friendship, at any time to\nbe preferred to old friends, as we are wont to prefer young horses to\nold ones? The doubt is unworthy of a human being, for there should be no\nsurfeit of friendships as there is of other things; and, as in the case\nof wines that improve with age, the oldest friendships ought to be the\nmost delightful; moreover, the well-known adage is true: \"Men must eat\nmany a peck of salt together before the claims of friendship are\nfulfilled.\"But new friendships are not to be scorned if they offer hope\nof bearing fruit, like green shoots of corn º that do not disappoint us\nat harvest-time; yet the old friendships must preserve their own place,\nfor the force of age and habit is very great. Nay, even in the case of\nthe horse just now referred to, everybody, nothing preventing, would\nrather use one to which he has grown accustomed than one that is\nuntrained and new. And habit is strong in the case not only of animate,\nbut also of inanimate things, since we delight even in places, though\nrugged and wild, in which we have lived for a fairly long time.</p>\n<p>But it is of the utmost importance in friendship that superior and\ninferior should stand on an equality. For oftentimes a certain\npre-eminence does exist, as was that of Scipio in what I may call \"our\nset.\" But he never affected any superiority over Philus, or Rupilius, or\nMummius, or over his other friends of a lower rank. For example, his\nbrother Quintus Maximus, a distinguished man, no doubt, though by no\nmeans his equal, was treated by him as a superior, because he was older\nthan himself. Indeed Scipio desired that he might be the cause of\nenhancing the dignity of all his friends. And this course every man\nshould adopt and imitate, so that if he is endowed with any superiority\nin virtue, intellect, or fortune he may impart it to his relatives and\nshare it with his next of kin; or if, for example, his parents are of a\nlowly station and his relatives are less favoured in mind or estate than\nhimself, he may increase the means of the one and be the source of\nhonour and influence to other; as in legends, men who have for a long\ntime lived the life of menials, because their lineage and family were\nunknown, although discovered and found to be the sons of gods or of\nkings, nevertheless retain affection for the shepherds whom for many\nyears they regarded as their parents. And surely such a feeling ought to\nbe much stronger in the case of real and undoubted parents. For the\nfruit of genius, of virtue, and, indeed, of every excellence, imparts\nits sweetest flavour when bestowed on those who are nearest and dearest\nto us. As, therefore, in the intimacy existing between friends and\nrelatives the superior should put himself on a level with his inferior,\nso the latter ought not to grieve that he is surpassed by the former in\nintellect, fortune, or position. But many of the latter kind are\ncontinually uttering some complaints or reproaches even, especially if\nthey think that they have done anything which they can speak of as an\nact of duty and of friendship, involving a certain amount of toil. A\nvery disagreeable class of people, certainly, are those who are ever\nobtruding their own services, which ought to be kept in mind by him for\nwhom they were performed and should not be mentioned by him who\nperformed them. As, therefore, in friendship, those who are superior\nshould lower themselves, so, in a measure, should they lift up their\ninferiors. For there are certain men who render friendships disagreeable\nby thinking themselves slighted - a thing which rarely happens, except\nin the case of persons who think that they really deserve to be\nslighted; but they ought to be relieved of such an opinion not by words\nonly but by action. Now, in the first place, you must render to each\nfriend as much aid as you can, and, in the second place, as much as he\nwhom you love and assist has the capacity to bear. For however eminent\nyou may be, you cannot lead all your friends through the various grades\nto the highest official rank, as Scipio was able to do when he made\nPublius Rupilius Rupilius consul, though he\ncould not accomplish this result in the case of his brother, Lucius\nRupilius. º But even if you could bestow upon another any honour you\nchose, yet you must consider what he is able to bear.</p>\n<p>As a rule decisions about friendships should be formed after strength\nand stability have been reached in mind and age; nor should men who in\nboyhood were devoted to hunting and games of ball, keep as their\nintimates those whom they loved at that period simply because they were\nfond of the same pursuits. For on that principle nurses and the slaves\nwho attended us to and from school, will, by right of priority of\nacquaintance, claim the largest share of our goodwill. I admit that they\nare not to be neglected, but they are to be regarded in an entirely\ndifferent way; under no other conditions can friendship remain secure.\nFor difference of character is attended by difference of taste that\nsevers friendships; nor is there any other cause why good men cannot be\nfriends to wicked men, or wicked men to good men, except that there is\nthe greatest possible distance between them in character and in taste.</p>\n<p>This rule also may properly be prescribed in friendship: Let not a sort\nof ungoverned goodwill (as very frequently happens) hinder your friends'\nadvantage in important matters. For indeed, if I may go back to legends,\nNeoptolemus could not have taken Troy if he had been willing to listen\nto Lycomedes, by whom he had been reared and who endeavoured with many\ntears to hinder him from setting out. Often, too, important duties arise\nwhich require the temporary separation of friends; and he who would\nhinder the discharge of those duties because he cannot easily bear his\ngrief at the absence of friends, is not only weak and effeminate, but,\non that very account, is far from reasonable in his friendship. In\nbrief, it is your duty on every occasion to consider carefully both what\nyou will demand from a friend and what you will permit him to obtain\nwhen he makes a demand on you.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, there is a sort of disaster in connexion with breaking off\nfriendships - for now our discussion descends from the intimacies of the\nwise to friendships of the ordinary kind- which is sometimes\nunavoidable. There are often in friends outbreaks of vice which affect\nsometimes their actual friends, sometimes strangers, yet so that the\ninfamy of the evil flows over on to the friends. Therefore the ties of\nsuch friendships should be sundered by a gradual relaxation of intimacy,\nand, as I have heard that Cato used to say, \"They should be unravelled\nrather than rent apart,\" unless there has been some outbreak of utterly\nunbearable wrongdoing, so that the only course consistent with rectitude\nand honour, and indeed the only one possible, is to effect an immediate\nwithdrawal of affection and association.</p>\n<p>But if, on the other hand, as usually happens, a mere change of\ndisposition and of tastes should occur, or if a difference in political\nviews should arise (for I am talking now, as I said a moment ago, not of\nfriendships existing between wise men, but of those of the ordinary\nkind), care must be taken lest it appear, not only that friendship has\nbeen put aside, but that open hostility has been aroused. For nothing is\nmore discreditable than to be at war with one with whom you have lived\non intimate terms. Scipio, as you both know, had severed his friendship\nwith Quintus Pompeius on my account;and, moreover, because of a\ndisagreement in politics, was estranged from my colleague, Metellus; he\nacted with deliberation and moderation in each instance, and without any\nbitter feeling of resentment. Wherefore, in the first place, pains must\nbe taken that, if possible, no discord should arise between friends, but\nin case it does, then our care should be that the friendships appear to\nhave burned out rather than to have been stamped out. And you must\nindeed be on your guard lest friendships be changed into serious\nenmities, which are the source of disputes, abuse, and invective. Yet\neven these, if endurable, are to be borne, and such respect is to be\npaid to the old-time friendship that he may be in the wrong who\ncommitted the offence and not he who suffered it.</p>\n<p>In short: there is but one security and one provision against these ills\nand annoyances, and that is, neither to enlist your love too quickly nor\nto fix it on unworthy men. Now they are worthy of friendship who have\nwithin their own souls the reason for their being loved. A rare class\nindeed! And really everything splendid is rare, and nothing is harder to\nfind than something which in all respects is a perfect specimen of its\nkind. But the majority of men recognize nothing whatever in human\nexperience as good unless it brings some profit and they regard their\nfriends as they do their cattle, valuing most highly those which give\nhope of the largest gain. Thus do they fail to attain that loveliest,\nmost spontaneous friendship, which is desirable in and for itself; and\nthey do not learn from their own experience what the power of such\nfriendship is and are ignorant of its nature and extent. For everyone\nloves himself, not with a view of acquiring some profit himself from his\nself-love, but because he is dear to himself on his own account; and\nunless this same feeling were transferred to friendship, the real friend\nwould never be found; for he is, as it were, another self.</p>\n<p>Now if it is evident in animals, whether of the air, the water, or the\nland, and whether tame or wild, first, that they love themselves - for\nthis feeling is born alike in every living creature - and, secondly,\nthat they require and eagerly search for other animals of their own kind\nto which they may attach themselves - and this they do with a longing in\nsome degree resembling human love - then how much more, by the law of\nhis nature, is this the case with man who both loves himself and uses\nhis reason to seek out another whose soul he may so mingle with his own\nas almost to make one out of two!</p>\n<p>But most men unreasonably, not to say shamelessly, want a friend to be\nsuch as they cannot be themselves and require from friends what they\nthemselves do not bestow. But the fair thing is, first of all, to be a\ngood man yourself and then to seek another like yourself. It is among\nsuch men that this stability of friendship, of which I have been\ntreating for some time, may be made secure; and when united by ties of\ngoodwill, they will first of all subdue those passions to which other\nmen are slaves; and, next, they will delight in what is equitable and\naccords with law, and will go to all lengths for each other; they will\nnot demand from each other anything unless it is honourable and just,\nand they will not only cherish and love, but they will also revere, each\nother. For he who takes reverence from friendship, takes away its\nbrightest jewel. Therefore a fatal mistake is made by those who think\nthat friendship opens wide the door to every passion and to every sin.\nFriendship was given to us by nature as the handmaid of virtue, not as a\ncomrade of vice; because virtue cannot attain her highest aims\nunattended, but only in union and fellowship with another. Such a\npartnership as this, whether it is, or was, or is yet to be, should be\nconsidered the best and happiest comradeship along the road to nature's\nhighest good. In such a partnership, I say, abide all things that men\ndeem worthy of pursuit - honour and fame and delightful tranquillity of\nmind; so that when these blessings are at hand life is happy, and\nwithout them, it cannot be happy.</p>\n<p>Since happiness is our best and highest aim, we must, if we would attain\nit, give our attention to virtue, without which we can obtain neither\nfriendship nor any other desirable thing; on the other hand, those who\nslight virtue and yet think that they have friends, perceive their\nmistake at last when some grievous misfortune forces them to put their\nfriends to the test. Therefore, I repeat the injunction, for it should\nbe said again and again: you should love your friend after you have\nappraised him; you should not appraise him after you have begun to love\nhim. But we are punished for our negligence in many things, and\nespecially are we most grievously punished for our carelessness in the\nchoice and treatment of our friends; for we deliberate after the event,\nand we do what the ancient proverb forbids - we argue the case after the\nverdict is found. Accordingly, after we have become involved with others\nin a mutual affection, either by long association or by interchange of\nfavours, some cause of offence arises and we suddenly break the bonds of\nfriendship asunder when it has run but half its course.</p>\n<p>Therefore carelessness so great in regard to a relation absolutely\nindispensable deserves the more to be censured. For the one thing in\nhuman experience about whose advantage all men with one voice agree, is\nfriendship; even virtue itself is regarded with contempt by many and is\nsaid to be mere pretence and display; many disdain riches, because they\nare content with little and take delight in meagre fare and plain dress;\npolitical honours, too, for which some have a burning desire - how many\nso despise them that they believe nothing more empty and nothing more\ninane! Likewise other things, which seem to some to be worthy of\nadmiration, are by many thought to be of no value at all. But concerning\nfriendship, all, to a man, think the same thing: those who have devoted\nthemselves to public life; those who find their joy in science and\nphilosophy; those who manage their own business free from public cares;\nand, finally, those who are wholly given up to sensual pleasures - all\nbelieve that without friendship life is no life at all, or at least they\nso believe if they have any desire whatever to live the life of free\nmen. For it creeps imperceptibly, I know not how, into every life, and\nsuffers no mode of existence to be devoid of its presence.</p>\n<p>Nay, even if anyone were of a nature so savage and fierce as to shun and\nloathe the society of men - such, for example, as tradition tells us a\ncertain Timon of Athens once was - yet even such a man could not refrain\nfrom seeking some person before whom he might pour out the venom of his\nembittered soul. Moreover, the view just expressed might best be\nappraised if such a thing as this could happen: suppose that a god\nshould remove us from these haunts of men and put us in some solitary\nplace, and, while providing us there in plenteous abundance with all\nmaterial things for which our nature yearns, should take from us\naltogether the power to gaze upon our fellow men - who would be such a\nman of iron as to be able to endure that sort of a life? And who is\nthere from whom solitude would not snatch the enjoyment of every\npleasure?True, therefore, is that celebrated saying of Archytas of\nTarentum, I think it was - a saying which I have heard repeated by our\nold men who in their turn heard it from their elders. It is to this\neffect: \"If a man should ascend alone into heaven and behold clearly the\nstructure of the universe and the beauty of the stars, there would be no\npleasure for him in the awe-inspiring sight, which would have filled him\nwith delight if he had had someone to whom he could describe what he had\nseen.\" Thus nature, loving nothing solitary, always strives for some\nsort of support, and man's best support is a very dear friend.</p>\n<p>But though this same nature declares by so many utterances what she\nwishes, what she seeks, and what she ardently longs for, yet we somehow\ngrow deaf and do not hearken to her voice. For varied and complex are\nthe experiences of friendship, and they afford many causes for suspicion\nand offence, which it is wise sometimes to ignore, sometimes to make\nlight of, and sometimes to endure. But there is one cause of offence\nwhich must be encountered in order that both the usefulness and loyalty\nof friendship may be preserved; for friends frequently must be not only\nadvised, but also rebuked, and both advice and rebuke should be kindly\nreceived when given in a spirit of goodwill. But somehow it is true, as\nput by my intimate friend in his Andria :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Complaisance gets us friends, plain speaking, hate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A troublesome thing is truth, if it is indeed the source of hate, which\npoisons friendship; but much more troublesome is complaisance, which, by\nshowing indulgence to the sins of a friend, allows him to be carried\nheadlong away; but the greatest fault is in him who both scornfully\nrejects truth and is driven by complaisance to ruin.</p>\n<p>Therefore, in this entire matter reason and care must be used, first,\nthat advice be free from harshness, and second, that reproof be free\nfrom insult. But in showing complaisance - I am glad to adopt Terence's\nword, obsequium - let courtesy be at hand, and let flattery, the\nhandmaid of vice, be far removed, as it is unworthy not only of a friend\nbut even of a free man; for we live in one way with a tyrant and in\nanother with a friend. Now we must despair of the safety of the man\nwhose ears are so closed to truth that he cannot hear what is true from\na friend. For there is shrewdness in that well-known saying of Cato, as\nthere was in much that he said: \"Some men are better served by their\nbitter-tongued enemies than by their sweet-smiling friends; because the\nformer often tell the truth, the latter, never.\" And furthermore, it is\nabsurd that men who are admonished do not feel vexation at what ought to\nvex them, but do feel it at what ought not; for they are annoyed, not at\nthe sin, but at the reproof; whereas, on the contrary, they ought to\ngrieve for the offence and rejoice at its correction.</p>\n<p>As, therefore, it is characteristic of true friendship both to give and\nto receive advice and, on the one hand, to give it with all freedom of\nspeech, but without harshness, and on the other hand, to receive it\npatiently, but without resentment, so nothing is to be considered a\ngreater bane of friendship than fawning, cajolery, or flattery; for give\nit as many names as you choose, it deserves to be branded as a vice\npeculiar to fickle and false-hearted men who say everything with a view\nto pleasure and nothing with a view to truth. Moreover, hypocrisy is not\nonly wicked under all circumstances, because it pollutes truth and takes\naway the power to discern it, but it is also especially inimical to\nfriendship, since it utterly destroys sincerity, without which the word\nfriendship can have no meaning. And since the effect of friendship is to\nmake, as it were, one soul out of many, how will that be possible if not\neven in one man taken by himself shall there be a soul always one and\nthe same, but fickle, changeable, and manifold?For what can be as pliant\nand erratic as the soul of the man who changes not only to suit\nanother's humour and desire, but even his expression and his nod?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He says \"nay,\" and \"nay\" say I; he says \"yea,\" and \"yea\" say I; in fine,\nI bade myself agree with him in everything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was said by Terence whom I quoted before, but he says it in the\ncharacter of Gnatho; and to have such a man for a friend on any terms is\na mark of inconstancy. However, there are many like Gnatho, though his\nsuperiors in birth, fortune, and reputation, who become dangerous\nflatterers when their insincerity is supported by their position. But by\nthe exercise of care a fawning friend may be separated and distinguished\nfrom a true friend, just as everything pretended and false may be\ndistinguished from what is genuine and true. A public assembly, though\ncomposed of very ignorant men, can, nevertheless, usually see the\ndifference between a demagogue - that is, a smooth-tongued, shallow\ncitizen - and one who has stability, sincerity, and weight. With what\nflattering words Gaius Papiriusnot long ago insinuated himself into the\nfavour of the assembly, when he was trying to carry a law making the\npeople's tribunes eligible for re‑election! I spoke against it - but I\nwill not talk of myself, it will give me more pleasure to talk about\nScipio. Ye gods! What weight and majesty there was in his speech on that\noccasion! One would have said, without hesitation, that he was the\nleader of the Roman people, not their comrade. But you both were\npresent; besides, his speech is published. As a result this \"people's\nlaw\" was rejected by the people's votes.</p>\n<p>Again - and pardon me for referring to myself - you remember when Lucius\nMancinus and Scipio's brother, Quintus Maximus, were consuls, how popular\napparently was the proposed law of Gaius Licinius Crassus regarding the\npriestly offices - for the right to co‑opt to vacancies possessed by the\ncollege was being converted into patronage for the people. (By the way,\nCrassus was the first man to begin the practice of facing towards the\nforum in addressing the people.)Nevertheless, through my speech in\nreply, reverence for the immortal gods easily prevailed over the\nplausible oration of Crassus. And this took place while I was praetor\nand five years before I was elected consul. Thus the cause was won more\nby its own merit than by the influence of one holding a very high\nofficial rank.</p>\n<p>Now, if on the stage, I mean on the platform, where there is the\ngreatest opportunity for deception and disguise, truth yet prevails,\nprovided it is made plain and brought into the light of day, what ought\nto be the case with friendship which is wholly weighed in the scales of\ntruth? For in friendship, unless, as the saying is, you behold and show\nan open heart, you can have no loyalty or certainty and not even the\nsatisfaction of loving and of being loved, since you do not know what\ntrue love is. And yet this flattery of which I spoke, however deadly it\nmay be, can harm no one except him who receives it and delights in it.\nIt follows that the man who lends the readiest ear to flatterers is the\none who is most given to self-flattery and is most satisfied with\nhimself.</p>\n<p>I grant that Virtue loves herself; for she best knows herself and\nrealizes how lovable she is; but it is not virtue I am talking about but\na reputation for virtue. For many wish not so much to be, as to seem to\nbe, endowed with real virtue. Such men delight in flattery, and when a\ncomplimentary remark is fashioned to suit their fancy they think the\nempty phrase is proof of their own merits. There is nothing, therefore,\nin a friendship in which one of the parties to it does not wish to hear\nthe truth and the other is ready to lie. Nor should we see any humour in\nthe fawning parasites in comedies if there were no braggart soldiers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In truth did Thais send me many thanks?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It would have been enough to answer, \"Many.\" \"Millions of them,\" said\nthe parasite. The flatterer always magnifies that which the one for\nwhose gratification he speaks wishes to be large. Wherefore, although\nthat sort of hollow flattery influences those who court and make a bid\nfor it, yet even stronger and steadier men should be warned to be on\ntheir guard lest they be taken in by flattery of the crafty kind.</p>\n<p>No one, to be sure, unless he is an utter fool, fails to detect the open\nflatterer, but we must exercise a watchful care against the deep and\ncrafty one lest he steal upon us unawares. For he is very hard to\nrecognize, since he often fawns even by opposing, and flatters and\ncajoles by pretending to quarrel, until at last he gives in, allowing\nhimself to be overcome so that his dupe may appear to have seen further\ninto the matter than himself. And yet, is there anything more\ndiscreditable than to be made a dupe? If not, then we should be all the\nmore on our guard that it does not happen to us to have to confess:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To-day, of all old fools that play the comic parts,\nYou've wheedled me the most and made your greatest dupe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For even on the stage the silliest characters take the parts of old men\nlacking in foresight and easily deceived.</p>\n<p>But in some unaccountable way I have drifted away from the friendship of\nfaultless men - that is, men of wisdom, such wisdom I mean as is\nobserved to fall to the lot of man - and I have rambled on to a\ndiscussion of friendships of the frivolous kind. Wherefore, let me\nreturn to the topic with which I began and finally put an end even to\nthat.</p>\n<p>Virtue, my dear Gaius Fannius, and you, my dear Quintus Mucius, Virtue,\nI say, both creates the bond of friendship and preserves it. For in\nVirtue is complete harmony, in her is permanence, in her is fidelity;\nand what she has raised her head and shown her own light and has seen\nand recognized the same light in another, she moves towards it and in\nturn receives its beams; as a result love or friendship leaps into\nflame; for both words derived from a word meaning \"to love.\"But love is\nnothing other than the great esteem and affection felt for him who\ninspires that sentiment, and it is not sought because of material need\nor for the sake of material gain. Nevertheless even this blossoms forth\nfrom friendship, although you did not make it your aim.</p>\n<p>Because of this friendly impulse, I, as a young man, became attached to\nthose old men, Lucius Paulus, Marcus Cato, Gaius Gallus, Publius Nasica,\nand Tiberius Gracchus, father-in‑law of my dear Scipio. And while that\nfeeling is stronger between men of the same age, as between Scipio,\nLucius Furius, Publius Rupilius, Spurius Mummius, and myself; yet, in\nturn, now that I am old, I find pleasure in the affection of young men,\nlike yourselves and Quintus Tubero; and I find delight also in social\nintercourse with still younger men like Publius Rutilius and Aulus\nVerginius. And since it is the law of human life and of human nature\nthat a new generation is ever coming forth, it is really most desirable,\nwhen you can, to reach the goal, so to speak, with men of your own age -\nthose with whom you began the race of life.</p>\n<p>But inasmuch as things human are frail and fleeting, we must be ever on\nthe search for some persons whom we shall love and who will love us in\nreturn; for if goodwill and affection are taken away, every joy is taken\nfrom life. For me, indeed, though he was suddenly snatched away, Scipio\nstill lives and will always live; for it was his virtue that caused my\nlove and that is not dead. Nor is it only in my sight and for me, who\nhad it constantly within my reach, that his virtue lives; it will even\nshed its light and splendour on men unborn. No one will ever undertake\nwith courage and hope the larger tasks of life without thinking that he\nmust continually keep before him the memory and example of that\nillustrious man.</p>\n<p>For my part, of all the blessings that fortune or nature has bestowed on\nme, there is none which I can compare with Scipio's friendship. In it I\nfound agreement on public questions; in it, counsel in private business,\nand in it, too, a leisure of unalloyed delight. And, so far as I was\naware, I never offended him in even the most trivial point; nor did I\never hear a word from him that I could wish unsaid; there was one home\nfor us both; we had the same fare and shared it in common, and we were\ntogether not only in our military campaigns, but also in our foreign\ntours and on our vacations in the country.</p>\n<p>Why need I speak of our constant devotion to investigation and to\nlearning in which, remote from the gaze of men, we spent all our leisure\ntime? If my recollection and memory of these things had died with him, I\ncould not now by any means endure the loss of a man so very near and\ndear to me. But those experiences with him are not dead; rather they are\nnourished and made more vivid by my reflection and memory; and even if I\nwere utterly deprived of the power to recall them, yet my age would of\nitself afford me great relief; for I cannot have much longer time to\nbear this bereavement; besides, every trial, which is of brief duration,\nought to be endurable, even if it be severe.</p>\n<p>This is all that I had to say about friendship; but I exhort you both so\nto esteem virtue (without which friendship cannot exist), that,\nexcepting virtue, you will think nothing more excellent than friendship.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Laelius De Amicitia by Cicero"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"pathSlug":"/cicero","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/yubikeys","title":"YubiKeys Aren't A New Hardware Token","tags":["yubico","yubikey","webauthn","fido","phishing","passwordless"]}},"next":null}}}
